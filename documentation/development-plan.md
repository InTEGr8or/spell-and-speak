# Development Plan for Spell-and-Speak App

## 1. Introduction

This is the intended development plan for the Spell-and-Speak web app.

This is a proof-of-concept application that will be sketched out and developed at the same time, so this document should be updated actively.

## 2. Development Stack
- **Front-end Framework**: React
- **Programming Language**: TypeScript
- **Runtime Environment**: Node.js
- **Storage**: Browser's LocalStorage for persisting user data

## 3. Application Architecture
The application will be a static website written in TypeScript transpiled to JavaScript.

The JavaScript will have to provide animation for dragging a `character-chip` and dropping it into an input box.

I library for converting text into speech will have to be included.

## 4. Local Storage Strategy
Local Storage will record the user's spelling achievements. 

As the user achieves each word, new word challenges are presented.

## 5. Deployment
- **Build Tool**: Create React App (for setting up the build process)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (for automating deployment to GitHub Pages)
- **Deployment Steps**: 
  - Run `npm run build` to create a production build.
  - Push the build to the `gh-pages` branch of the repository.

## 6. Hosting
- **Platform**: GitHub Pages
- **URL**: `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/`
- **Custom Domain Configuration**: Choose a simple domain name.

## 7. Maintenance and Update Strategy
Simplest deployment and maintenance for this POC.

## 8. Security Considerations
Don't collect any Personally Identifiable Information.
