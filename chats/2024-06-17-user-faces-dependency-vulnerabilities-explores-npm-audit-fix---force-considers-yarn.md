I don't seem to understand how `npm audit fix --force` works.

It seems to oscillate between 6 high priority vulnurabilities and 68 high priority vulnuerabilities, and I can't figure out if there's any way to reduce them to zero.

The `npm audit fix --force` command attempts to automatically fix vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies by updating to newer, non-vulnerable versions of the packages. However, the `--force` flag will override some protections and may introduce breaking changes by installing major version updates that are not backward compatible.

The oscillation in the number of reported vulnerabilities can happen for a few reasons:

1. **Dependency Tree Complexity:** Your project has a complex web of dependencies. When `npm` updates one package to fix a vulnerability, it can lead to different versions of other packages being installed, which might introduce new vulnerabilities.

2. **Outdated Dependencies:** Some dependencies may not have been updated by their maintainers to address vulnerabilities or might be deprecated. Thus, even after an update, vulnerabilities remain.

3. **SemVer Major Changes:** Using `--force` can result in major version upgrades that might not be compatible with your current setup. This can lead to an unstable build or even more vulnerabilities from other dependencies that were compatible with older versions.

To reduce vulnerabilities to zero:

1. **Update One Package at a Time:** Instead of using `--force`, manually update packages one by one. This approach allows you to review breaking changes and ensure compatibility.

2. **Check for Deprecated Packages:** If you receive warnings about deprecated packages, find alternatives or newer versions that serve the same purpose.

3. **Review Breaking Changes:** Before updating a package, review its changelog for breaking changes that may affect your project.

4. **Run Regular Audits:** Regularly run `npm audit` without the `--force` flag to get a report on vulnerabilities and follow the suggested actions.

5. **Consider a Different Tool:** If `npm audit` is not providing satisfactory results, you could try another security scanning tool like `Snyk` or `Yarn` (if you're open to switching package managers).

Remember that it's not always possible to have zero vulnerabilities, especially with complex projects. Focus on fixing high-severity issues and keep your dependencies as up-to-date as possible within the constraints of your project's requirements.

How do I switch to yarn? Just delete the `package-lock.json` and the `node_modules/*` and then run `yarn`? I already have yarn installed.

---

**Codeium** _at 10:04 am, Jun 17, 2024_

Yes, to switch from npm to Yarn, you can follow these general steps:

1. **Delete `node_modules` Directory:** This removes all the currently installed npm packages.

    ```sh
    rm -rf node_modules/
    ```

2. **Delete `package-lock.json` File:** This file is specific to npm and should be replaced by Yarn's equivalent (`yarn.lock`).

    ```sh
    rm package-lock.json
    ```

3. **Initialize Yarn:** Run `yarn` to install the dependencies defined in `package.json` and create the `yarn.lock` file.

    ```sh
    yarn
    ```

After these steps, Yarn will manage your project's dependencies. Make sure to commit the new `yarn.lock` file and any other changes to your version control system.

Note: If you have any scripts or CI/CD pipelines that use npm commands, you will need to update them to use Yarn commands. For example, replace `npm start` with `yarn start`, `npm install` with `yarn`, and `npm test` with `yarn test`.

Does `Yarn` do a better job?

---

**Codeium** _at 10:21 am, Jun 17, 2024_

Yarn and npm are both popular package managers with their own sets of features and benefits. Whether Yarn does a "better job" can depend on your specific requirements and preferences. Here are some points to consider:

**Performance:**
- Yarn has historically been praised for faster package installation times due to its efficient use of caching and parallel operations.
- Yarn's workspaces are useful for managing monorepo setups efficiently.

**Security:**
- Yarn and npm both have mechanisms to audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities (`yarn audit` and `npm audit`, respectively).
- Yarn's lockfile format provides stricter and more consistent locking, which may improve security by ensuring that the same dependency versions are used every time.

**User Experience:**
- Yarn often provides more detailed and readable output during installations and upgrades.
- Yarn's CLI syntax is quite similar to npm's, which makes it easy for users to switch between the two.

**Features:**
- Yarn has built-in support for workspaces, which is great for managing multiple packages within a single repository.
- Yarn can enforce version consistency across packages with its `resolutions` field.
- npm has caught up with many of Yarn's initial advantages, and with npm v7+, there's now support for workspaces and improved performance.

**Community and Support:**
- npm is the default package manager for Node.js and is backed by GitHub (Microsoft), which means it has strong community support.
- Yarn was created by Facebook and also has a strong community. It is used by many large-scale applications and Facebook projects.

Ultimately, whether Yarn does a better job for you might come down to trying both in your specific context and seeing which one aligns better with your workflow, provides the performance you need, or offers the features you find most useful. Both package managers are being actively developed and improved, so it's also a good idea to stay updated with the latest changes from both projects.

The message "Yarn requires Node.js 4.0 or higher to be installed" is a generic message indicating that Yarn needs a compatible version of Node.js. Since you are running Node.js version 20.12.1, which is well above the required version, this message is not indicative of the actual issue.

The installation command you used should normally work. However, since you're using Windows and you have Yarn installed via Scoop (as indicated by the Scoop path in the output), you should update Yarn using Scoop instead of the install script. Here's how you can update Yarn using Scoop:

```powershell
scoop update yarn
```

Using Scoop will ensure that Yarn is updated in the way that is consistent with how it was originally installed on your system. If you encounter any more issues, make sure that the `scoop` directory is correctly included in your `PATH` environment variable.

The error you're encountering, `error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported`, is related to a change in Node.js 17+ where OpenSSL 3.0 is used, which causes issues with some older packages that haven't been updated to work with this new version of OpenSSL.

To work around this issue, you have a couple of options:

1. **Set the Node.js Crypto Policy:**
   You can try setting the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable to use the legacy provider as a short-term workaround:

   ```pwsh
   $env:NODE_OPTIONS = "openssl-legacy-provider"
   yarn start
   ```

   If this works, you can set this environment variable globally in your system, or include it in your project's `package.json` under the `scripts` section, like so:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "react-scripts start",
     "start-fix": "NODE_OPTIONS=openssl-legacy-provider react-scripts start",
     // other scripts...
   }
   ```

   And then run `yarn start-fix` instead of `yarn start`.

2. **Downgrade Node.js:**
   If the workaround above doesn't solve the issue, or if you prefer a more stable fix, you might consider downgrading to Node.js 16 or another LTS (Long-Term Support) version that does not have this issue.

   Using `nvm` or `nvm-windows`, you can easily switch between Node.js versions:

   ```bash
   nvm install 16
   nvm use 16
   ```

   After downgrading, try running your app again with `yarn start`.

3. **Update Dependencies:**
   Sometimes, updating your project's dependencies can resolve the issue, especially if newer versions of the packages are compatible with OpenSSL 3.0. Since you are using `react-scripts`, make sure you have the latest version that supports Node.js 17+.

   You can update `react-scripts` and other dependencies to their latest versions and then try to start your app again.

Before making any changes, ensure that your project's code is committed to version control so you can easily revert if needed. If you're working with a team, communicate these changes to ensure everyone is on the same page regarding the Node.js version and environment settings.

I am using your `nvm use 16` suggestion, but when I deploy to GitHub I get an error on `npm ci`, so I think I have to update my `deploy.yml`

If you've switched to using Yarn locally and are using Node.js version 16, you need to update your GitHub Actions workflow to use Yarn for dependency installation and building your project. Here's how you can update your `deploy.yml` to use Yarn:

```yaml
name: GitHub Actions Workflow
permissions:
  contents: write
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build_deploy:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [16] # We will deploy with only one version of node

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      # Yarn is used for installing dependencies and building the project
      - name: Install dependencies with yarn
        run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile
      - name: Build with yarn
        run: yarn build
      - name: Deploy to gh-pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # GitHub automatically creates a GITHUB_TOKEN secret to use in your workflow
          publish_dir: ./build
          publish_branch: gh-pages
          cname: spell-and-speak.com
```

In this updated workflow:

- The `npm ci` command is replaced with `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` to install dependencies. The `--frozen-lockfile` flag ensures that Yarn doesn't generate a new `yarn.lock` file and fails if an update is needed, similar to `npm ci`.
- The `npm run build --if-present` command is replaced with `yarn build` to build your project using Yarn.

Make sure to commit and push these changes to the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file in your repository to update the workflow.

  Line 307:6:  React Hook useCallback has an unnecessary dependency: 'state.inputBoxChips'. Either exclude it or remove the dependency array  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
```

It pertains to this:

```js
 // MARK: sayWord and useEffets
 // Say the characters in the input boxes
 const sayWordWithBrowser = useCallback((word) => {
  // Use the SpeechSynthesis API to pronounce the word
  const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(word);
  utterance.rate = 0.6;
  utterance.voice = getVoice();
  window.speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);
 }, [state.inputBoxChips]); // Include state.inputBoxChips in the dependency array
```

But I think I need that dependency.

**Codeium** _at 12:20 pm, Jun 17, 2024_

The `useCallback` hook is used to memoize a function between renders, and the dependency array defines when the function should be recalculated. If `state.inputBoxChips` is used inside `sayWordWithBrowser` and changes to it should cause the function to update, then it should indeed be included in the dependency array.

However, from the provided code snippet, `state.inputBoxChips` is not directly used within `sayWordWithBrowser`. Therefore, ESLint's `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` rule is warning you that the dependency is unnecessary.

If you are certain that changes to `state.inputBoxChips` should trigger a recalculation of the `sayWordWithBrowser` function (perhaps because it indirectly affects something within `getVoice()` or `word` that isn't shown in the snippet), then you may keep it in the dependency array. In that case, you should ensure that all variables/functions that actually change when `state.inputBoxChips` changes are also included in the dependency array.

If `state.inputBoxChips` does not affect the calculation of the function and was included in the dependency array by mistake, you should remove it:

```javascript
const sayWordWithBrowser = useCallback((word) => {
  // Use the SpeechSynthesis API to pronounce the word
  const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(word);
  utterance.rate = 0.6;
  utterance.voice = getVoice();
  window.speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);
}, []); // Removed state.inputBoxChips from the dependency array
```

Make sure that you include any other variables or functions that are used within `sayWordWithBrowser` and should trigger an update when they change. If `getVoice` uses `state.inputBoxChips` internally and changes when `state.inputBoxChips` changes, then `getVoice` should be included in the dependency array, and it should also be wrapped in a `useCallback` or `useMemo` hook if it's a function or value that is recalculated.
