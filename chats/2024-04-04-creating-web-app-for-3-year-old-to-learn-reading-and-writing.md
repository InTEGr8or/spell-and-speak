summary: The user wants to create a web app to help their 3-year-old granddaughter learn to read and write. They describe the app's features, such as displaying words, pronouncing them using text-to-speech, and providing interactive spelling exercises. The user also envisions a collaborative project plan involving three experts sharing their thoughts to create the app. They seek guidance on creating a document, preferably a Software Requirements Specification (SRS), to guide the development process. Codeium responds by outlining an SRS document for the "spell-and-speak" web app, covering aspects such as project scope, user classes, system features, external interfaces, non-functional requirements, and more. The SRS serves as a comprehensive guide for developing the educational app.

# Codeium Chat Conversation

Note: _This is purely the output of the chat conversation and does not contain any raw data, codebase snippets, etc. used to generate the output._

**User** _at 6:29 pm, Apr 4, 2024_

I need to create a web app to help my 3-year-old granddaughter learn to read and write. I need your help creating it. 

It will be an interactive TypeScript web app that focuses on a simple-to-use mobile-friendly front end. 

The first page of the application, which I will call spell-and-speak, will present the user with a word such as "Cat", It will pronounce the word using a text-to-speech library and display the word for a configurable time period starting with 2 seconds and then the word will fade out over 1 second. Below where the word was displayed there will be a number of boxes corresponding to the number of characters in the word, called the `input-boxes`. Below the `input-boxes` will be a `character-tray`, which will contain a set of random `character-chip`s, which be graphical squares each containing a single character. The `character-tray` will contain all the characters needed to spell the word, plus 50% more random characters. Each `character-chip` will be movable by tapping on it and moving it with your finger. The child will be able to move any of the characters into any `input-box`, at which point it will be centered into the box. Each `input-box` can hold only one character. Dragging a new character into an `input-box` will replace any existing content of that `input-box` and put that content back into the `character-tray`. Each time the child places a character into an input box the application will pronounce the string of characters that are in the `input-boxes` parsing any empty boxes as a space key.

You will imagine three highly intelligent experts working together on this spell-and-speak project. They will follow a tree of thoughts approach, where each expert shares their thought process step by step. They will consider the input from others, refine their thoughts, and build upon the other expert's feedback. Generate the project plan in the most appropriate document type which I will be able to use to create the rest of the project and use industry-standard specification documentation that will provide the most guidance and automation opportunities for continued development.

Given the scope of the project you're describing, the most appropriate document type for generating the project plan would be a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. An SRS is a comprehensive description of the intended purpose and environment for software under development. It describes the functional and non-functional requirements, detailing what the software will do and how it will be expected to perform.

Here's an outline of the SRS for your "spell-and-speak" web app:

# Software Requirements Specification for Spell-and-Speak Web App

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed overview of our web application, "spell-and-speak," designed to help children learn to read and write. This document will cover the functional, non-functional, and interface requirements for the app.

### 1.2 Document Conventions
This Document is written in Markdown for easy conversion to various formats and readability.

### 1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
This document is intended for the development team, project stakeholders, and the educational professionals advising the development process.

### 1.4 Project Scope
The "spell-and-speak" app will present words to the user, pronounce them using text-to-speech technology, and allow the user to interactively spell the words using a drag-and-drop interface.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The product will be a standalone web application accessible via standard web browsers with a focus on mobile-friendly interfaces.

### 2.2 Product Functions
- Display words to the user.
- Utilize text-to-speech to pronounce words.
- Allow users to spell words using draggable character chips.
- Pronounce the spelled string as characters are placed in input boxes.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
The primary users of the application will be children aged 3 and up. The interface will be simple and intuitive, requiring minimal to no reading ability.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
The app will be designed to run on modern web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge on both desktop and mobile platforms.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- Must be compatible with touchscreen devices.
- Should be developed using TypeScript and run on Node.js environment.
- Text-to-speech functionality must be supported across all target platforms.

### 2.6 User Documentation
Interactive tutorials and help sections will be provided within the app.

## 3. System Features

### 3.1 Word Presentation and Pronunciation
#### 3.1.1 Description and Priority
High priority feature that displays the word and pronounces it using text-to-speech.

#### 3.1.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences
- On load: A new word is presented and pronounced.
- After a configurable delay: The word fades out.

### 3.2 Interactive Spelling Interface
#### 3.2.1 Description and Priority
High priority feature that allows the user to drag and drop character chips into input boxes.

#### 3.2.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences
- On character chip move: The character is placed into an input box and the app pronounces the current string.

### 3.3 Character Tray
#### 3.3.1 Description and Priority
Medium priority feature that holds the necessary and additional random character chips.

#### 3.3.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences
- On word presentation: The tray is populated with the necessary and extra characters.
