I want the app to pronounce the `currentWord` when a new word is initialized, and I want it to pronounce the string of characters in the `input-boxes` when a `characterChip` is added to an `input-box`, but it is currently pronouncing the `input-boxes` string _and then_ the `currentWord` whenever a character is added to an `input-box`

---

**Codeium** _at 2:42 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

To address the issue of the app pronouncing both the `input-boxes` string and the `currentWord` whenever a character is added to an `input-box`, you should ensure that the `sayWord` function is only called in the context where you want the string to be pronounced.

Based on the context provided, it seems that `sayWord` is being called within a `useEffect` that is triggered when `hasDropped` changes. If `hasDropped` is being set to `true` both when a new word is initialized and when a `characterChip` is added to an `input-box`, this would explain why both pronunciations are happening.

Here's how you can separate the two scenarios:

1. Pronounce `currentWord` when a new word is initialized:
   - Trigger the pronunciation in the `useEffect` that is responsible for initializing the new word.
   - Call `sayWord` with the `currentWord` as an argument.

2. Pronounce the `input-boxes` string when a `characterChip` is added:
   - Trigger the pronunciation after updating the state with the new `inputBoxChips`.
   - Make sure this call to `sayWord` does not include pronouncing the `currentWord`.

To fix the issue, let's start by refining the `useEffect` that is intended to pronounce `currentWord` when a new word is initialized. You need to have a `useEffect` that listens to changes in `currentWord` and pronounces it:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (currentWord) {
    // Pronounce the current word
    sayWord(currentWord);
  }
}, [currentWord]); // Add the currentWord to the dependency array
```

Next, modify the logic that handles dropping a `characterChip` into an `input-box` to only trigger the pronunciation of the `input-boxes` string:

```javascript
const processChipDrop = useCallback((draggedChipId, targetInputBoxId) => {
  // ... your existing logic for processing chip drop

  // After updating the state, pronounce the string of characters in the input-boxes
  sayWord();

  // Make sure to not pronounce the currentWord here
}, [/* include necessary dependencies, such as sayWord */]);
```

Ensure that the `handleSayWord` function is not being called unnecessarily. It should only be called in the context where you want to pronounce the string from the `input-boxes`. Additionally, ensure that the `useEffect` that responds to `hasDropped` changes does not mistakenly call `handleSayWord` in the wrong context.

If you could provide the specific parts of the code where the new word is initialized and where the chips are dropped, I could give you a more precise solution.

I need to create a VS Code launch configuration that will attach to a currently running React app in Edge.

---

**Codeium** _at 2:53 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

To create a Visual Studio Code launch configuration that will attach to a currently running React app in Microsoft Edge, you'll need to use the Debugger for Microsoft Edge extension. If you haven't already installed this extension, you can find it in the VS Code Marketplace.

Here's how you can create the launch configuration:

1. Open your project in VS Code.
2. Go to the Run view by clicking on the Run icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
3. Click on the 'create a launch.json file' link if you don't already have one in your project.
4. Select 'Edge' as the environment. This should generate a basic configuration for you.

The generated configuration should look something like this:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Launch Edge against localhost",
      "type": "edge",
      "request": "launch",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000",
      "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/src"
    }
  ]
}
```

Since you want to attach to a running instance of Edge, you'll need to change the `request` type from `launch` to `attach` and add a `port` that the debugger will attach to. The default port for the Edge debugger is `9222`. You'll also need to make sure Edge is running with remote debugging enabled.

Here's an example configuration for attaching to a running Edge instance:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Attach to Edge",
      "type": "edge",
      "request": "attach",
      "port": 9222,
      "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/src",
      "sourceMaps": true,
      "urlFilter": "http://localhost:3000/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

To ensure that Edge is running with remote debugging enabled, you'll need to start it with the following command (or set it to start with these parameters by default):

```shell
msedge.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

Now, with Edge running and remote debugging enabled, you can use the VS Code debugger to attach to it by selecting the 'Attach to Edge' configuration from the debug configurations dropdown and clicking the green 'Start Debugging' button.

Remember, the `urlFilter` should match the URL of your running React application. Adjust the `port` if your application is running on a different port, and ensure that your `webRoot` correctly points to the directory where your source files are located.

It's saying "Could not connect to the target at localhost:9222. Could not connect to debug target"

---

**Codeium** _at 2:57 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

The error message "Could not connect to the target at localhost:9222. Could not connect to debug target" suggests that the VS Code debugger is unable to establish a connection to the Edge browser instance on port 9222. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Ensure Edge is running with remote debugging enabled**:
   Make sure that Microsoft Edge is running with the `--remote-debugging-port=9222` flag. You can do this by closing all Edge instances and then starting Edge from the command line with the required flag:

   ```shell
   "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222
   ```

   *Note: The actual path to `msedge.exe` might vary depending on your installation.*

2. **Check if the port is already in use**:
   It's possible that another process is using port 9222. You can check this by using the `netstat` command in the command prompt or PowerShell:

   ```shell
   netstat -ano | findstr :9222
   ```

   If you see a result, it means the port is already in use. You'll either need to close the process using that port or choose a different port for remote debugging.

3. **Review your launch.json configuration**:
   Double-check the `launch.json` configuration to make sure the `port` is set to 9222 and that you're using the `attach` request type. Here's the snippet again for reference:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "Attach to Edge",
     "type": "edge",
     "request": "attach",
     "port": 9222,
     "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/src",
     "sourceMaps": true,
     "urlFilter": "http://localhost:3000/*"
   }
   ```

4. **Check Edge DevTools**:
   Open Edge and go to `edge://inspect` to see if the debugger is available for attachment. There should be a list of pages that are open and available for debugging.

5. **Disable any firewalls or proxies**:
   Sometimes, firewalls or proxy settings can block the connection to the specified port. Ensure that your firewall allows incoming connections on port 9222.

6. **Restart your computer**:
   If none of the above steps work, try restarting your computer to clear up any potential issues with lingering processes or port assignments.

If you've confirmed that Edge is running with remote debugging enabled and your configuration is correct, but you're still facing this issue, then it could be a more specific problem with your development environment, network configuration, or a unique issue with the Debugger for Microsoft Edge extension.

Also, make sure you are using the latest version of Microsoft Edge and the Debugger for Microsoft Edge extension, as updates may contain fixes for issues like this.

I started the server with `npm start`. Do I need to do something different?

---

**Codeium** _at 2:58 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

When you start your React app with `npm start`, it usually launches the development server and opens your default web browser to display your app. However, this does not automatically enable remote debugging for the Microsoft Edge browser. To enable remote debugging, you need to start an instance of Edge with the `--remote-debugging-port` flag as mentioned earlier.

Here's what you need to do:

1. **Ensure Edge is not already running**:
   Close all Edge browser windows. This is important because Edge needs to be started with the remote debugging flag, and it won't work if an instance of Edge is already running without it.

2. **Start Edge with remote debugging**:
   Open a command prompt or terminal window and start Edge with the `--remote-debugging-port` flag set to `9222` (or another port of your choice):

   ```shell
   "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222
   ```

   Adjust the path if your Edge is installed in a different location.

3. **Open your React app**:
   After starting Edge with remote debugging enabled, manually navigate to the URL where your React app is running (usually `http://localhost:3000` or similar).

4. **Attach VS Code debugger**:
   Switch back to VS Code, and in the `launch.json` configuration, make sure you have an attach configuration set up correctly:

   ```json
   {
     "version": "0.2.0",
     "configurations": [
       {
         "name": "Attach to Edge",
         "type": "edge",
         "request": "attach",
         "port": 9222,
         "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
         "sourceMaps": true,
         "urlFilter": "http://localhost:3000/*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

5. **Start debugging in VS Code**:
   With Edge running and your React app loaded in the browser, go to the Run and Debug view in VS Code, select 'Attach to Edge' from the dropdown, and click the green play button to start debugging.

By following these steps, you should be able to attach the VS Code debugger to your running React app in Edge. Remember that the `--remote-debugging-port` flag needs to be set each time you want to enable remote debugging in Edge.

When I put a breakpoint in `sayWord()` and it gets called a second time (which I don't want) when I drag a chip, I can follow the call stack back to this, but I can't see what calls this.

How can I follow a call stack back in React and find out what event caused the code to run?

```
 // Use an effect to call your callback after the state has been updated
 useEffect(() => {
  if (hasDropped) {
   // Call your callback function
   handleSayWord();

   // Reset the drop indicator
   dispatch({ type: ActionTypes.SET_HAS_DROPPED, payload: false })
  }
 }, [hasDropped, handleSayWord, dispatch]); // Make sure to list all dependencies here
```

---

**Codeium** _at 8:54 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

In React, the call stack doesn't always provide clear insight into what caused a particular piece of code to run, especially when dealing with asynchronous actions or updates from hooks like `useEffect`. However, there are a few methods you can use to trace back and find out what is triggering your code:

1. **Debugging with Breakpoints**:
   - In the `useEffect` hook, you can place a breakpoint on the line where `handleSayWord` is called.
   - When the breakpoint hits, you can examine the call stack in your browser's developer tools. This might not give you the complete picture because React batches updates and handles them asynchronously, but it can provide some clues.

2. **Logging**:
   - Add `console.log` statements in the `useEffect` hook and in any other places where `hasDropped` is being set to `true`.
   - Include enough information in your log statements to identify where the call is coming from. For example: `console.log('hasDropped set to true in function XYZ')`.

3. **React DevTools**:
   - Use the React Developer Tools extension for your browser. It has a "Components" tab that lets you inspect the current props and state of your React components.
   - React DevTools also have a "Profiler" tab that can record what components are rendering and what caused the render. This can give you insights into what caused state changes.

4. **Following State Updates**:
   - If `hasDropped` is being set to `true` by dispatching an action, follow where that action is dispatched in your codebase.
   - Search for occurrences of `dispatch({ type: ActionTypes.SET_HAS_DROPPED, payload: true })` to find all the places in your code where `hasDropped` might be set.

5. **Check Propagation of Events**:
   - If the state change is caused by an event (like a click or drag event), ensure that you're calling `event.stopPropagation()` if necessary to prevent the event from bubbling up to parent elements that might also handle the same event.

6. **Reducer Logging**:
   - If you are using `useReducer`, you can add logging to your reducer function to log actions as they are dispatched. This can help you track down when and why `hasDropped` is being updated:

   ```javascript
   const reducer = (state, action) => {
     console.log(action);
     // ... rest of the reducer logic
   };
   ```

7. **Custom Hooks**:
   - If the logic is complex, consider writing a custom hook that encapsulates the state logic. Within that hook, you can add logs or debugger statements to help trace the flow of events and state changes.

By combining these techniques, you should be able to trace back through your application's flow and determine what is causing `handleSayWord` to be called when you don't expect it to be.

Ok, I was wrong. That code was from where the first run of `sayWord` is called and it pronounces the `input-boxes` string. That was the run that I want. 

The run that I don't want is called from this code:

```js
 useEffect(() => {
  // If the currentWord changes and is not empty, start the fade-out effect
  if (currentWord) {
   handleSayWord(currentWord);
   startFadeOut();
  }
 }, [currentWord, startFadeOut, handleSayWord]);
```

---

**Codeium** _at 8:58 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

The `useEffect` you've shown is designed to run `handleSayWord` and `startFadeOut` whenever `currentWord` changes and is not empty. This means that `handleSayWord` will be called every time `currentWord` is updated in your state.

If `handleSayWord` is being called unexpectedly, it suggests that `currentWord` is being updated somewhere in your application when dropping a character chip. To prevent `handleSayWord` from being called on chip drop, you need to ensure that `currentWord` is only updated when you intentionally want to set a new word, not when characters are being added to `input-boxes`.

Here are a few steps you can take to track down and fix the issue:

1. **Search for `setCurrentWord` Calls**:
   Look through your codebase for any calls to `setCurrentWord` (or however you're updating `currentWord` in your state). You want to make sure that this is only being called when you actually want to change the word, not during the chip drop actions.

2. **Review State Update Logic**:
   Check the logic associated with dropping a character chip. Ensure that it's only updating the state relevant to the `input-boxes` and not inadvertently causing `currentWord` to change.

3. **Check for Propagation Issues**:
   If the state update is tied to an event (e.g., a click or drop event), make sure you're not propagating the event to a parent handler that might update `currentWord`.

4. **Refactor `handleSayWord`**:
   If `handleSayWord` should only be called under certain conditions, consider adding additional state or checks to ensure it's only called when appropriate.

5. **Separate Concerns**:
   If the `currentWord` is being used for multiple purposes (e.g., initializing the game and also for checking what to pronounce), you might want to separate these concerns. For example, use a different piece of state to track the word that should be pronounced.

6. **Debugging**:
   Use `console.log` or breakpoints to pinpoint exactly where `currentWord` is being updated in your code. This can help you to understand why `handleSayWord` is being called a second time.

7. **State Dependencies**:
   Make sure that other state updates are not causing a re-render that might lead to an unexpected update of `currentWord`.

By carefully reviewing where and how `currentWord` is being updated, you can likely identify why the second call to `handleSayWord` is occurring. Once you've identified the cause, you can adjust your logic to ensure that `currentWord` is only updated when you want to start the fade-out effect and pronounce a new word.

`currentWord` is only set in here. It was set in `initialState` but I removed that.

```js
  case ActionTypes.INIT_NEW_WORD: {
   const { newWord, newInputBoxChips, shuffledCharacters } = action.payload;
   return {
    ...state,
    currentWord: newWord,
    inputBoxChips: newInputBoxChips,
    characterChips: shuffledCharacters,
    fadeOut: false,
   };
  }
```

---

**Codeium** _at 9:04 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

If `currentWord` is only set in the `ActionTypes.INIT_NEW_WORD` case within your reducer and nowhere else, then the second invocation of `handleSayWord` when you drop a character chip is likely due to the `INIT_NEW_WORD` action being dispatched at that time.

To find out why the `INIT_NEW_WORD` action is being dispatched when a chip is dropped, you'll need to locate where the `dispatch` function is called with `INIT_NEW_WORD`. Here's what to look for:

1. Search for the dispatch call in your codebase:
   Look for any line that dispatches the `INIT_NEW_WORD` action, which might look something like this:

   ```javascript
   dispatch({
     type: ActionTypes.INIT_NEW_WORD,
     payload: {
       newWord,
       newInputBoxChips,
       shuffledCharacters
     }
   });
   ```

2. Review the component or function that dispatches `INIT_NEW_WORD`:
   Once you've found the dispatch call, check under which conditions it is being executed. It should only be dispatched when you want to initialize a new word, not when a chip is dropped.

3. Check for accidental dispatches:
   Ensure that the dispatch call is not being executed unintentionally, such as inside an event handler meant for dropping chips, or as part of a callback that gets called more often than intended.

4. Debugging:
   If the above steps don't clarify why the dispatch is being called, add a `console.log` or breakpoint right before the dispatch of `INIT_NEW_WORD`. Check the call stack at that point to see what event or action led to it.

5. Ensure conditional logic is correct:
   If the dispatch is part of a sequence of operations, ensure that any conditional logic around the dispatch is correct and that it is not mistakenly falling through to dispatch `INIT_NEW_WORD`.

6. Double-check related effects:
   If you're using `useEffect` to dispatch `INIT_NEW_WORD`, make sure the dependencies are correct and that it's not responding to state changes that should not trigger a new word initialization.

7. Review state dependencies:
   Ensure no other state updates or side effects are causing a re-render that might lead to an unexpected dispatch of `INIT_NEW_WORD`.

By examining the situations under which `INIT_NEW_WORD` is dispatched, you should be able to determine why `handleSayWord` is being called with the new word when a chip is dropped and prevent it from happening at the wrong time.

**User** _at 9:06 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

I put a breakpoint at the return of `case ActionTypes.INIT_NEW_WORD` and that breakpoint is not hit when I drag and drop a chip and the `sayWord` is run twice.

---

**Codeium** _at 9:06 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

If the breakpoint in the `ActionTypes.INIT_NEW_WORD` case of your reducer is not hit when you drag and drop a chip, it suggests that the issue is not with dispatching `INIT_NEW_WORD` again. There must be another reason why `handleSayWord(currentWord)` is being called from the second `useEffect` you mentioned earlier.

Here's a step-by-step approach to further troubleshoot the issue:

1. **Verify `currentWord` Updates**:
   Since the unwanted call to `handleSayWord` is in a `useEffect` that depends on `currentWord`, verify if `currentWord` is actually changing when you drag and drop a chip. You can do this by adding a `console.log` statement or using a debugger to inspect the value of `currentWord` before and after dragging and dropping a chip.

   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     console.log('Current word is now:', currentWord);
     if (currentWord) {
       handleSayWord(currentWord);
       startFadeOut();
     }
   }, [currentWord, startFadeOut, handleSayWord]);
   ```

2. **Check for Component Re-renders**:
   Inspect whether the component containing the `useEffect` is re-rendering for some reason, causing the effect to run again. You can use the React DevTools' "Profiler" tab to record and inspect component renders.

3. **Debug `handleSayWord` Directly**:
   Since the reducer case for `INIT_NEW_WORD` does not seem to be the issue, put a breakpoint or a `console.log` directly inside the `handleSayWord` function. This will allow you to inspect when and why it's getting called:

   ```javascript
   const handleSayWord = (word) => {
     console.log('handleSayWord called with:', word);
     // Rest of the function...
   };
   ```

   Use the call stack or log output to see what leads to the call.

4. **Inspect Other Effects or Callbacks**:
   If you have other `useEffect` hooks, `useCallback` hooks, or event handlers that might be calling `handleSayWord`, inspect those as well. It's possible that something else is triggering the function call without changing `currentWord`.

5. **Review State Synchronization**:
   If you use a global state management library (like Redux) or React's Context API, ensure that there's no synchronization issue causing unexpected updates to `currentWord`.

6. **Prop Drilling Issues**:
   If `currentWord` is passed down as a prop to child components, ensure that it's not being modified or causing child components to re-render and call `handleSayWord` indirectly.

7. **Check for Asynchronous Operations**:
   If there are any asynchronous operations that result in calling `handleSayWord`, make sure they are properly managed and not causing race conditions or unexpected calls.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify why `handleSayWord` is being called unexpectedly. Once you find the cause, you can apply the necessary fix to ensure that `handleSayWord` is only called when `currentWord` is intentionally updated to a new word.

**User** _at 9:13 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

I get a bunch of this:

```log
handleSayWord called with word: SHEEP
App.js:284 Current word is now: SHEEP
App.js:119 handleSayWord called with word: undefined
App.js:119 handleSayWord called with word: SHEEP
App.js:284 Current word is now: SHEEP
App.js:284 Current word is now: SHEEP
App.js:119 handleSayWord called with word: undefined
App.js:119 handleSayWord called with word: SHEEP
App.js:284 Current word is now: SHEEP
```

---

**Codeium** _at 9:14 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

The log output indicates that `handleSayWord` is being called multiple times: with the word "SHEEP", with `undefined`, and then with "SHEEP" again. The `undefined` call suggests there might be a reset or clearing of the `currentWord` somewhere in your code that is not directly tied to the `INIT_NEW_WORD` action.

Here are steps to further diagnose the issue:

1. **Check the Order of Logs**:
   The order in which these log statements appear is crucial. They suggest that the `currentWord` is set to "SHEEP", then cleared (set to `undefined`), and then set to "SHEEP" again. This pattern repeats, which might indicate a re-rendering issue or an issue with how state is being managed.

2. **Identify `undefined` Calls**:
   Look for any places in your code where `currentWord` could possibly be set to `undefined`. This could happen if the state is being reset or if there's an error in the logic that sets `currentWord`.

3. **Check for Multiple State Updates in Quick Succession**:
   If you are updating the state of `currentWord` in multiple places very quickly, React might batch these updates, resulting in the function being called multiple times. Ensure that state updates are not being made in rapid succession in a way that could cause this behavior.

4. **Inspect Parent and Child Components**:
   If `currentWord` is being passed down to child components, check if any of those components could be causing the state to update unexpectedly.

5. **Analyze Conditional Rendering**:
   If your component tree conditionally renders based on `currentWord`, it could be unmounting and remounting components, causing effects to run multiple times.

6. **Review Asynchronous Code**:
   If you have asynchronous code that updates `currentWord`, make sure that it has been correctly implemented and doesn't lead to race conditions.

7. **Check for External Triggers**:
   If you're using external libraries or APIs that might change the state, make sure they are not interfering with your state management.

8. **Use State Transition Debugging**:
   You can add debugging statements right before every state transition for `currentWord` to log the previous and next values. This way, you understand exactly where and why the state is changing.

9. **Revisit `useEffect` Dependencies**:
   Make sure that `handleSayWord` and `startFadeOut` are stable (not being re-created on each render) if they are included in the dependency array. If they are re-created frequently, consider using `useCallback` to memoize them.

Based on the log output, you need to find out why `currentWord` is being set to `undefined` and then being set back to "SHEEP". Once you identify where this is happening, you should be able to prevent the unwanted calls to `handleSayWord`. Consider adding more detailed logs surrounding the state updates of `currentWord` to track down the exact lines of code affecting the state.

`undefined` is from when I drag a character, which pulls the string from the `input-boxes` inside the `sayWord` funciton and does not require a word to be passed in.

The log output indicates that the function is being called multiple times. The function is being called twice: once with the variable `am` and once with the variable `null`.

You can see here that that `sayWord` receives an `undefined` and then it pronounces the `input-boxes`, then it pronounces the the `currentWord` even though the `currentWord` is unchanged:

```js
handleSayWord called with word: undefined
App.js:114 Utterance.text: O 
App.js:120 handleSayWord called with word: OCTOPUS
App.js:114 Utterance.text: OCTOPUS
App.js:285 Current word is now: OCTOPUS
App.js:285 Current word is now: OCTOPUS
App.js:120 handleSayWord called with word: undefined

App.js:120 handleSayWord called with word: OCTOPUS
App.js:114 Utterance.text: OCTOPUS
App.js:285 Current word is now: OCTOPUS
```

**Codeium** _at 9:59 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

The log output you provided suggests that `handleSayWord` is indeed being called twice: first with `undefined`, which triggers the pronunciation of the `input-boxes` string, and then with `OCTOPUS`, which triggers the pronunciation of the `currentWord`. This happens despite the fact that `currentWord` hasn't changed, as indicated by the repeated log "Current word is now: OCTOPUS".

Given this behavior, it's possible that the `useEffect` hook triggering the pronunciation of `currentWord` might be the culprit, as it's not dependent on a change of `currentWord` but rather its existence:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // If the currentWord changes and is not empty, start the fade-out effect
  if (currentWord) {
    handleSayWord(currentWord);
    startFadeOut();
  }
}, [currentWord, startFadeOut, handleSayWord]);
```

The above `useEffect` will run not only when `currentWord` changes, but also when `startFadeOut` or `handleSayWord` functions change (if they are not memoized with `useCallback`, for example). It will also run after the initial render if `currentWord` is initialized with a non-empty value.

To prevent `handleSayWord` from being called with `currentWord` when a chip is added to an `input-box`, you might want to add a check that ensures it's only called when `currentWord` actually changes to a new word.

Here's an approach to ensure that `handleSayWord` is only called when `currentWord` changes:

1. Track the previous value of `currentWord`.

```javascript
const [prevWord, setPrevWord] = useState("");

useEffect(() => {
  if (currentWord && currentWord !== prevWord) {
    handleSayWord(currentWord);
    startFadeOut();
    setPrevWord(currentWord);
  }
}, [currentWord, prevWord, startFadeOut, handleSayWord]);
```

2. Alternatively, since `currentWord` should not change when a chip is added, you might want to consider separating the concerns: use different states or callbacks for handling the `input-boxes` string and `currentWord`.

For debugging purposes, you may also add a log inside the `useEffect` to see when it's being triggered:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('useEffect triggered for currentWord:', currentWord);
  if (currentWord && currentWord !== prevWord) {
    handleSayWord(currentWord);
    startFadeOut();
    setPrevWord(currentWord);
  }
}, [currentWord, prevWord, startFadeOut, handleSayWord]);
```

This way, you can ensure `handleSayWord` is only called when the `currentWord` actually updates to a new value, rather than just because `currentWord` exists.

**User** _at 10:03 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

Your item #2! How can I do that?

---

**Codeium** _at 10:03 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

To separate the concerns of pronouncing the `currentWord` when it's initialized and pronouncing the string from `input-boxes` when a chip is dropped, you can create two distinct functions: one for handling the new word initialization and another for handling the chip drop event. This way, you can control when each pronunciation should occur.

Here is a possible approach:

1. **Separate the pronunciation logic**:
   Define two separate functions: one for pronouncing `currentWord` when it changes (`pronounceCurrentWord`), and another for pronouncing the `input-boxes` string (`pronounceInputBoxes`).

```javascript
// This function is called only when the currentWord changes.
const pronounceCurrentWord = useCallback(() => {
  if (currentWord) {
    handleSayWord(currentWord);
  }
}, [currentWord, handleSayWord]);

// This function is called when a chip is dropped into an input-box.
const pronounceInputBoxes = useCallback(() => {
  // Assuming handleSayWord can handle undefined to construct the word from input boxes
  handleSayWord();
}, [handleSayWord]);
```

2. **Update `useEffect` for new word initialization**:
   Use `pronounceCurrentWord` inside a `useEffect` that only runs when `currentWord` changes. This effect should not be triggered by chip drops.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  pronounceCurrentWord();
  // Start fade-out effect or any other related logic for new word initialization here.
  startFadeOut();
}, [pronounceCurrentWord, startFadeOut]);
```

3. **Call `pronounceInputBoxes` when a chip is dropped**:
   Call `pronounceInputBoxes` from the event handler that is responsible for handling the drop event of a chip.

```javascript
// This is your existing logic to handle the drop event.
const handleChipDrop = (/* parameters for chip drop */) => {
  // Your logic to update the input-box state with the new chip data

  // After updating the state, call the function to pronounce the input boxes string.
  pronounceInputBoxes();
};
```

4. **Ensure that `handleSayWord` is not called elsewhere unexpectedly**:
   Check your code to make sure that `handleSayWord` is not being invoked in any other places besides these two scenarios.

By implementing these changes, you separate the logic for pronouncing the `currentWord` upon initialization from the logic for pronouncing the string of characters in the `input-boxes` when a chip is dropped. This should prevent `handleSayWord` from being called twice in the same flow and ensure that each pronunciation occurs in its intended context.

**User** _at 10:25 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

I think I've separated all that out to two functions and it's still just saying the current word every time I drop a chip.

---

**Codeium** _at 10:26 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

If the app is still pronouncing the `currentWord` every time you drop a chip despite separating out the concerns, it's likely that the `useEffect` which calls `pronounceCurrentWord` is still being triggered on chip drop. This could happen if the `currentWord` state is somehow being updated on chip drop, or if the dependencies of the `useEffect` are not set correctly.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

1. **Verify `currentWord` State**:
   Ensure that `currentWord` is not being updated when a chip is dropped. `currentWord` should only change when you're initializing a new word, not when you're updating `inputBoxChips`.

2. **Review `useEffect` Dependencies**:
   Check the dependencies of the `useEffect` that calls `pronounceCurrentWord`. The effect should only have `currentWord` as a dependency if `pronounceCurrentWord` itself does not change.

   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     pronounceCurrentWord();
     startFadeOut();
   }, [currentWord]); // Only currentWord should be a dependency
   ```

3. **Check for Unintended Renders**:
   Use React Developer Tools to inspect when and why your component is re-rendering. Look for unexpected renders that might be causing the `useEffect` to run.

4. **Inspect `pronounceCurrentWord`**:
   Check the definition of `pronounceCurrentWord` to ensure that it is correctly memoized with `useCallback` and that its dependency array is set correctly.

5. **Audit Chip Drop Logic**:
   Go to the logic that handles the chip drop and ensure that it's only calling `pronounceInputBoxes`. It should not cause any side effects that might lead to `currentWord` being updated or `pronounceCurrentWord` being called.

6. **Add Debugging Logs**:
   Add `console.log` statements to the chip drop logic, `pronounceCurrentWord`, and the `useEffect` that calls `pronounceCurrentWord`. Log out important pieces of state and any relevant actions taken.

   ```javascript
   const pronounceCurrentWord = useCallback(() => {
     console.log(`Pronouncing current word: ${currentWord}`);
     handleSayWord(currentWord);
   }, [currentWord, handleSayWord]);

   useEffect(() => {
     console.log(`useEffect triggered for currentWord: ${currentWord}`);
     pronounceCurrentWord();
     startFadeOut();
   }, [currentWord, startFadeOut, pronounceCurrentWord]);
   ```

7. **Ensure Correct Use of `dispatch`**:
   Double-check that no `dispatch` calls related to `currentWord` are being made on chip drop.

8. **Review `pronounceInputBoxes` Usage**:
   Confirm that `pronounceInputBoxes` is being used properly and that it does not indirectly affect `currentWord`.

By carefully reviewing each part of the relevant logic and adding debugging information, you should be able to identify why the `useEffect` is being triggered and prevent `currentWord` from being pronounced on chip drop. If the issue persists, please provide the updated code snippets for `pronounceCurrentWord`, `pronounceInputBoxes`, the chip drop logic, and the `useEffect` that is causing the problem, so I can help you further diagnose the issue.

**User** _at 10:32 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

It was the `useEffect` that is calling `pronounceCurrentWord()`. It's working now. I have a very poor understanding of how `useEffect` code is triggered and the meaning of `useEffect` dependencies. Could you explain that?

---

**Codeium** _at 10:32 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

Certainly! Understanding how `useEffect` works and how its dependencies affect its behavior is crucial when working with React functional components.

### `useEffect` Basics

`useEffect` is a hook in React that lets you perform side effects in function components. Side effects are operations that can affect other components or can't be done during rendering, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.

Here's a basic syntax of `useEffect`:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Your side effect code here.
}, [dependencies]);
```

- The first argument is a function that React will run after flushing changes to the DOM.
- The second argument is an array of dependencies that the effect depends on.

### Dependency Array

The dependency array is a list of variables that, when changed, will trigger the effect. Here’s what happens depending on what’s passed in this array:

- **No dependency array (`useEffect` without second argument)**: The effect runs after every completed render.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // This runs after every render.
});
```

- **Empty dependency array (`[]`)**: The effect runs once after the initial render, acting like `componentDidMount`.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // This runs once, similar to componentDidMount.
}, []);
```

- **Array with dependencies**: The effect runs after the initial render and every time any dependency value changes.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // This runs after the initial render and every time any dependency changes.
}, [dependency1, dependency2]);
```

### Rules of `useEffect`

1. **React guarantees the DOM has been updated by the time it runs the effects**.

2. **Effects run for every render, not just once**. This is why React also cleans up effects from the previous render before running the effects next time.

3. **React applies the effect after allowing the browser to paint**, so the user won’t feel any rendering lag.

4. **Effects are declared inside the component** so they have access to its state and props.

### Cleaning up an Effect

Sometimes you need to run some additional code to clean up your effect (for subscriptions, timers, etc.). This is done by returning a function from the effect:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Set up a subscription...
  return () => {
    // Clean up the subscription...
  };
}, [dependencies]);
```

### Common Pitfalls

- **Forgetting to specify dependencies**: Leads to effects running more or less often than you intend.
- **Specifying the wrong dependencies**: Can lead to stale closures (functions that close over stale values from previous renders).
- **Over-specifying dependencies**: May cause effects to rerun with the same effective values.

### Tips for `useEffect`

- **Use multiple effects to separate concerns** rather than a single effect with a complex logic.
- **Optimize performance by making sure the dependency array is accurate** so that the effect only runs when needed.
- **Use `useCallback` to memoize callbacks** that are dependencies of `useEffect` hooks to prevent unnecessary reruns.

Understanding when and why `useEffect` runs can dramatically improve the performance of your application and help prevent bugs related to state synchronization and side effects.

When I try to deploy the updated working site to GitHub and it runs the `deploy.yml` I get these errors, but if I add those dependencies back in I get the double-speak again.

```log

  Line 327:6:  React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'pronounceCurrentWord' and 'startFadeOut'. Either include them or remove the dependency array  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
```

**Codeium** _at 10:47 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

The error messages you're seeing are from ESLint's `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` rule, which is part of the `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` package. This rule enforces that all dependencies of `useEffect` hooks are specified in the dependency array. It's intended to help you avoid bugs that could occur due to missing dependencies and stale closures.

However, there are scenarios where you might intentionally exclude certain dependencies from the dependency array, particularly if including them would cause the effect to run too often or reintroduce the issue you just fixed.

To resolve this issue without reintroducing the double-speak bug, you have a couple of options:

1. **Refactor Your Code**:
   If possible, refactor your code to ensure that the functions you pass into the dependency array are stable and don't change on every render. You can often achieve this by using the `useCallback` hook to memoize callback functions.

   ```javascript
   const pronounceCurrentWord = useCallback(() => {
     // Function body
   }, [currentWord]);

   const pronounceInputBoxes = useCallback(() => {
     // Function body
   }, []);
   ```

   Then, you can include these callbacks in your `useEffect` dependency arrays safely:

   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     // Effect that depends on pronounceCurrentWord
   }, [pronounceCurrentWord]);

   useEffect(() => {
     // Effect that depends on pronounceInputBoxes
   }, [pronounceInputBoxes]);
   ```

2. **Disable the Rule Locally**:
   If you're confident that your effect is correct as-is, and including the dependencies would cause incorrect behavior, you can disable the rule for that specific line using an ESLint comment.

   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     // Your effect logic here
     // ...
   }, [/* No dependencies */]); // eslint-disable-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
   ```

   This tells ESLint to ignore the `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` rule for this specific `useEffect`. Use this option with caution, as it bypasses the safety check provided by the rule.

3. **Disable the Rule Globally**:
   If you find that you need to bypass this rule often (which shouldn't generally be the case), you can disable the rule in your ESLint configuration file. However, this is not recommended, as it removes an important check for the correctness of your `useEffect` hooks across your whole project.

Choose the best option for your situation. Often, the best approach is to refactor your code to comply with the rule, as this can help prevent subtle bugs. Only disable the rule if you are certain that the dependencies should not be included and that the effect's logic is correct.

I want to run a `sed` script from the command line that will find and replace all content in a folder replacing `sell-and-speak` with `sell-and-speak-build`.

---

**Codeium** _at 11:49 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

To perform a find and replace operation on all files within a folder using `sed`, you can combine it with the `find` command to target files and `xargs` to pass the file names to `sed`. The exact command may vary slightly depending on your operating system and shell environment.

Here is a `sed` command that you can run in a Unix-like terminal (like Bash in Linux or macOS) to recursively find and replace all occurrences of `sell-and-speak` with `sell-and-speak-build` within files of a folder:

```shell
find /path/to/folder -type f -exec sed -i '' 's/sell-and-speak/sell-and-speak-build/g' {} +
```

- `/path/to/folder`: The path to the folder where the files are located.
- `-type f`: This tells `find` to look for files only.
- `-exec`: This allows `find` to execute a command on the matched files.
- `sed -i '' 's/sell-and-speak/sell-and-speak-build/g'`: This is the `sed` command that performs the replacement.
  - `-i ''`: Edit files in-place (makes backup if extension supplied). The option `-i ''` is used for macOS. If you're using GNU sed (typically on Linux), you should use `-i` without the empty quotes.
  - `'s/sell-and-speak/sell-and-speak-build/g'`: The substitution command in `sed`. `s` stands for substitute, `g` stands for global (replace all occurrences).

Remember to replace `/path/to/folder` with the actual path to the directory containing your files.

**Note**: Before running such a command, it is highly recommended to back up the entire folder or at least test the command on a few sample files to ensure it performs as expected. The `-i` flag in `sed` will modify your files in place, which means the original content will be overwritten.

---

**User** _at 11:51 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

is that `find` recursive?

---

**Codeium** _at 11:51 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

Yes, the `find` command is recursive by default. When you specify a directory path as an argument, `find` will search through the specified directory and all of its subdirectories for files that match the given criteria.

For example, the command:

```shell
find /path/to/folder -type f -exec sed -i '' 's/sell-and-speak/sell-and-speak-build/g' {} +
```

will search for all files (`-type f`) starting in `/path/to/folder` and in all directories within it, and it will apply the `sed` command to each file found.

This behavior makes `find` very powerful for operations that need to be applied to a whole directory tree. Just make sure to use it with care, especially when combining it with commands that modify files, like `sed -i`.

---

**User** _at 11:53 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

How do I do the find in the whole current drectory and subfolders.

---

**Codeium** _at 11:53 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

To perform the find and replace operation with `sed` in the current directory and all of its subdirectories, you don't need to specify a full path. Instead, you can use `.` (dot) to represent the current directory. Here's the command:

For macOS (BSD sed):

```shell
find . -type f -exec sed -i '' 's/sell-and-speak/sell-and-speak-build/g' {} +
```

For Linux (GNU sed):

```shell
find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/sell-and-speak/sell-and-speak-build/g' {} +
```

- `.`: Specifies the current directory.
- `-type f`: Tells `find` to look for files only.
- `-exec`: Allows `find` to execute a command on the matched files.
- `sed -i`: Runs `sed` with the `-i` flag for in-place editing. On macOS, you need an empty string (`''`) after `-i` to indicate no backup, whereas on Linux, you just use `-i` without an additional argument.
- `'s/sell-and-speak/sell-and-speak-build/g'`: The `sed` substitution command to replace `sell-and-speak` with `sell-and-speak-build` globally within each file.

This command will search for and modify files starting from the current directory you are in when you execute the command. Be sure to back up your files before running this command, as it will permanently alter them.

---

**User** _at 11:54 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

We are in Windows. I have BusyBox installed which provides `sed`

---

**Codeium** _at 11:54 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

If you're on Windows and have BusyBox installed, you can use its `find` and `sed` utilities to perform the operation. Open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to perform the find and replace. Then execute the following command:

```shell
find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/sell-and-speak/sell-and-speak-build/g' {} \;
```

Here's what each part of the command does:

- `.`: Specifies the current directory as the starting point for the recursive search.
- `-type f`: Tells `find` to restrict the search to files only.
- `-exec`: Instructs `find` to execute the given command for each file found.
- `sed -i`: Invokes `sed` to perform in-place editing of the files. BusyBox's `sed` might not require an empty string for the `-i` parameter like macOS does.
- `'s/sell-and-speak/sell-and-speak-build/g'`: The `sed` substitution command to replace `sell-and-speak` with `sell-and-speak-build` globally within each file.
- `{}`: A placeholder that `find` replaces with the name of the current file being processed.
- `\;`: Indicates the end of the command that `find` executes.

This command will recursively find all files in the current directory and subdirectories and use `sed` to replace occurrences of `sell-and-speak` with `sell-and-speak-build`.

**Note**: Before running the command on your actual files, it's a good practice to test it on a small set of sample files or directories to ensure that it works as expected. Additionally, make sure to back up your files in case you need to revert the changes.

**User** _at 11:57 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

I am getting an error. I think it might be better to use `pwsh`.

---

**Codeium** _at 11:57 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

If you are encountering issues with BusyBox on Windows and you'd like to use PowerShell (which is available as `pwsh` on Windows), you can perform a recursive find and replace using PowerShell cmdlets.

Here's a PowerShell command that you can run to search for all files in the current directory and its subdirectories, and replace `sell-and-speak` with `sell-and-speak-build` in each file:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File | ForEach-Object {
    (Get-Content $_.FullName) -replace 'sell-and-speak', 'sell-and-speak-build' | Set-Content $_.FullName
}
```

Here's what each part of the command does:

- `Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File`: Gets all files in the current directory and its subdirectories.
- `ForEach-Object`: Processes each file object from the pipeline.
- `Get-Content $_.FullName`: Reads the content of the file.
- `-replace 'sell-and-speak', 'sell-and-speak-build'`: Replaces all occurrences of `sell-and-speak` with `sell-and-speak-build`.
- `Set-Content $_.FullName`: Writes the updated content back to the file.

Open PowerShell, navigate to the directory you want to perform the find and replace in, and then run the above command.

**Important Notes**: 

- PowerShell's `-replace` operator uses regex for the search pattern, so if `sell-and-speak` could be interpreted as a regex with special characters, you might need to escape them.
- This operation will modify the files in place, so be sure to back up your files before running the command to prevent any data loss.
