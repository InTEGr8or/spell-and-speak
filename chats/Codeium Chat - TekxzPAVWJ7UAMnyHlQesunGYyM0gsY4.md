I want the app to pronounce the `currentWord` when a new word is initialized, and I want it to pronounce the string of characters in the `input-boxes` when a `characterChip` is added to an `input-box`, but it is currently pronouncing the `input-boxes` string _and then_ the `currentWord` whenever a character is added to an `input-box`

---

**Codeium** _at 2:42 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

To address the issue of the app pronouncing both the `input-boxes` string and the `currentWord` whenever a character is added to an `input-box`, you should ensure that the `sayWord` function is only called in the context where you want the string to be pronounced.

Based on the context provided, it seems that `sayWord` is being called within a `useEffect` that is triggered when `hasDropped` changes. If `hasDropped` is being set to `true` both when a new word is initialized and when a `characterChip` is added to an `input-box`, this would explain why both pronunciations are happening.

Here's how you can separate the two scenarios:

1. Pronounce `currentWord` when a new word is initialized:
   - Trigger the pronunciation in the `useEffect` that is responsible for initializing the new word.
   - Call `sayWord` with the `currentWord` as an argument.

2. Pronounce the `input-boxes` string when a `characterChip` is added:
   - Trigger the pronunciation after updating the state with the new `inputBoxChips`.
   - Make sure this call to `sayWord` does not include pronouncing the `currentWord`.

To fix the issue, let's start by refining the `useEffect` that is intended to pronounce `currentWord` when a new word is initialized. You need to have a `useEffect` that listens to changes in `currentWord` and pronounces it:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (currentWord) {
    // Pronounce the current word
    sayWord(currentWord);
  }
}, [currentWord]); // Add the currentWord to the dependency array
```

Next, modify the logic that handles dropping a `characterChip` into an `input-box` to only trigger the pronunciation of the `input-boxes` string:

```javascript
const processChipDrop = useCallback((draggedChipId, targetInputBoxId) => {
  // ... your existing logic for processing chip drop

  // After updating the state, pronounce the string of characters in the input-boxes
  sayWord();

  // Make sure to not pronounce the currentWord here
}, [/* include necessary dependencies, such as sayWord */]);
```

Ensure that the `handleSayWord` function is not being called unnecessarily. It should only be called in the context where you want to pronounce the string from the `input-boxes`. Additionally, ensure that the `useEffect` that responds to `hasDropped` changes does not mistakenly call `handleSayWord` in the wrong context.

If you could provide the specific parts of the code where the new word is initialized and where the chips are dropped, I could give you a more precise solution.

I need to create a VS Code launch configuration that will attach to a currently running React app in Edge.

---

**Codeium** _at 2:53 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

To create a Visual Studio Code launch configuration that will attach to a currently running React app in Microsoft Edge, you'll need to use the Debugger for Microsoft Edge extension. If you haven't already installed this extension, you can find it in the VS Code Marketplace.

Here's how you can create the launch configuration:

1. Open your project in VS Code.
2. Go to the Run view by clicking on the Run icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
3. Click on the 'create a launch.json file' link if you don't already have one in your project.
4. Select 'Edge' as the environment. This should generate a basic configuration for you.

The generated configuration should look something like this:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Launch Edge against localhost",
      "type": "edge",
      "request": "launch",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000",
      "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/src"
    }
  ]
}
```

Since you want to attach to a running instance of Edge, you'll need to change the `request` type from `launch` to `attach` and add a `port` that the debugger will attach to. The default port for the Edge debugger is `9222`. You'll also need to make sure Edge is running with remote debugging enabled.

Here's an example configuration for attaching to a running Edge instance:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Attach to Edge",
      "type": "edge",
      "request": "attach",
      "port": 9222,
      "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/src",
      "sourceMaps": true,
      "urlFilter": "http://localhost:3000/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

To ensure that Edge is running with remote debugging enabled, you'll need to start it with the following command (or set it to start with these parameters by default):

```shell
msedge.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

Now, with Edge running and remote debugging enabled, you can use the VS Code debugger to attach to it by selecting the 'Attach to Edge' configuration from the debug configurations dropdown and clicking the green 'Start Debugging' button.

Remember, the `urlFilter` should match the URL of your running React application. Adjust the `port` if your application is running on a different port, and ensure that your `webRoot` correctly points to the directory where your source files are located.

It's saying "Could not connect to the target at localhost:9222. Could not connect to debug target"

---

**Codeium** _at 2:57 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

The error message "Could not connect to the target at localhost:9222. Could not connect to debug target" suggests that the VS Code debugger is unable to establish a connection to the Edge browser instance on port 9222. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Ensure Edge is running with remote debugging enabled**:
   Make sure that Microsoft Edge is running with the `--remote-debugging-port=9222` flag. You can do this by closing all Edge instances and then starting Edge from the command line with the required flag:

   ```shell
   "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222
   ```

   *Note: The actual path to `msedge.exe` might vary depending on your installation.*

2. **Check if the port is already in use**:
   It's possible that another process is using port 9222. You can check this by using the `netstat` command in the command prompt or PowerShell:

   ```shell
   netstat -ano | findstr :9222
   ```

   If you see a result, it means the port is already in use. You'll either need to close the process using that port or choose a different port for remote debugging.

3. **Review your launch.json configuration**:
   Double-check the `launch.json` configuration to make sure the `port` is set to 9222 and that you're using the `attach` request type. Here's the snippet again for reference:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "Attach to Edge",
     "type": "edge",
     "request": "attach",
     "port": 9222,
     "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/src",
     "sourceMaps": true,
     "urlFilter": "http://localhost:3000/*"
   }
   ```

4. **Check Edge DevTools**:
   Open Edge and go to `edge://inspect` to see if the debugger is available for attachment. There should be a list of pages that are open and available for debugging.

5. **Disable any firewalls or proxies**:
   Sometimes, firewalls or proxy settings can block the connection to the specified port. Ensure that your firewall allows incoming connections on port 9222.

6. **Restart your computer**:
   If none of the above steps work, try restarting your computer to clear up any potential issues with lingering processes or port assignments.

If you've confirmed that Edge is running with remote debugging enabled and your configuration is correct, but you're still facing this issue, then it could be a more specific problem with your development environment, network configuration, or a unique issue with the Debugger for Microsoft Edge extension.

Also, make sure you are using the latest version of Microsoft Edge and the Debugger for Microsoft Edge extension, as updates may contain fixes for issues like this.

I started the server with `npm start`. Do I need to do something different?

---

**Codeium** _at 2:58 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

When you start your React app with `npm start`, it usually launches the development server and opens your default web browser to display your app. However, this does not automatically enable remote debugging for the Microsoft Edge browser. To enable remote debugging, you need to start an instance of Edge with the `--remote-debugging-port` flag as mentioned earlier.

Here's what you need to do:

1. **Ensure Edge is not already running**:
   Close all Edge browser windows. This is important because Edge needs to be started with the remote debugging flag, and it won't work if an instance of Edge is already running without it.

2. **Start Edge with remote debugging**:
   Open a command prompt or terminal window and start Edge with the `--remote-debugging-port` flag set to `9222` (or another port of your choice):

   ```shell
   "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222
   ```

   Adjust the path if your Edge is installed in a different location.

3. **Open your React app**:
   After starting Edge with remote debugging enabled, manually navigate to the URL where your React app is running (usually `http://localhost:3000` or similar).

4. **Attach VS Code debugger**:
   Switch back to VS Code, and in the `launch.json` configuration, make sure you have an attach configuration set up correctly:

   ```json
   {
     "version": "0.2.0",
     "configurations": [
       {
         "name": "Attach to Edge",
         "type": "edge",
         "request": "attach",
         "port": 9222,
         "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
         "sourceMaps": true,
         "urlFilter": "http://localhost:3000/*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

5. **Start debugging in VS Code**:
   With Edge running and your React app loaded in the browser, go to the Run and Debug view in VS Code, select 'Attach to Edge' from the dropdown, and click the green play button to start debugging.

By following these steps, you should be able to attach the VS Code debugger to your running React app in Edge. Remember that the `--remote-debugging-port` flag needs to be set each time you want to enable remote debugging in Edge.

When I put a breakpoint in `sayWord()` and it gets called a second time (which I don't want) when I drag a chip, I can follow the call stack back to this, but I can't see what calls this.

How can I follow a call stack back in React and find out what event caused the code to run?

```
 // Use an effect to call your callback after the state has been updated
 useEffect(() => {
  if (hasDropped) {
   // Call your callback function
   handleSayWord();

   // Reset the drop indicator
   dispatch({ type: ActionTypes.SET_HAS_DROPPED, payload: false })
  }
 }, [hasDropped, handleSayWord, dispatch]); // Make sure to list all dependencies here
```

---

**Codeium** _at 8:54 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

In React, the call stack doesn't always provide clear insight into what caused a particular piece of code to run, especially when dealing with asynchronous actions or updates from hooks like `useEffect`. However, there are a few methods you can use to trace back and find out what is triggering your code:

1. **Debugging with Breakpoints**:
   - In the `useEffect` hook, you can place a breakpoint on the line where `handleSayWord` is called.
   - When the breakpoint hits, you can examine the call stack in your browser's developer tools. This might not give you the complete picture because React batches updates and handles them asynchronously, but it can provide some clues.

2. **Logging**:
   - Add `console.log` statements in the `useEffect` hook and in any other places where `hasDropped` is being set to `true`.
   - Include enough information in your log statements to identify where the call is coming from. For example: `console.log('hasDropped set to true in function XYZ')`.

3. **React DevTools**:
   - Use the React Developer Tools extension for your browser. It has a "Components" tab that lets you inspect the current props and state of your React components.
   - React DevTools also have a "Profiler" tab that can record what components are rendering and what caused the render. This can give you insights into what caused state changes.

4. **Following State Updates**:
   - If `hasDropped` is being set to `true` by dispatching an action, follow where that action is dispatched in your codebase.
   - Search for occurrences of `dispatch({ type: ActionTypes.SET_HAS_DROPPED, payload: true })` to find all the places in your code where `hasDropped` might be set.

5. **Check Propagation of Events**:
   - If the state change is caused by an event (like a click or drag event), ensure that you're calling `event.stopPropagation()` if necessary to prevent the event from bubbling up to parent elements that might also handle the same event.

6. **Reducer Logging**:
   - If you are using `useReducer`, you can add logging to your reducer function to log actions as they are dispatched. This can help you track down when and why `hasDropped` is being updated:

   ```javascript
   const reducer = (state, action) => {
     console.log(action);
     // ... rest of the reducer logic
   };
   ```

7. **Custom Hooks**:
   - If the logic is complex, consider writing a custom hook that encapsulates the state logic. Within that hook, you can add logs or debugger statements to help trace the flow of events and state changes.

By combining these techniques, you should be able to trace back through your application's flow and determine what is causing `handleSayWord` to be called when you don't expect it to be.

Ok, I was wrong. That code was from where the first run of `sayWord` is called and it pronounces the `input-boxes` string. That was the run that I want. 

The run that I don't want is called from this code:

```js
 useEffect(() => {
  // If the currentWord changes and is not empty, start the fade-out effect
  if (currentWord) {
   handleSayWord(currentWord);
   startFadeOut();
  }
 }, [currentWord, startFadeOut, handleSayWord]);
```

---

**Codeium** _at 8:58 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

The `useEffect` you've shown is designed to run `handleSayWord` and `startFadeOut` whenever `currentWord` changes and is not empty. This means that `handleSayWord` will be called every time `currentWord` is updated in your state.

If `handleSayWord` is being called unexpectedly, it suggests that `currentWord` is being updated somewhere in your application when dropping a character chip. To prevent `handleSayWord` from being called on chip drop, you need to ensure that `currentWord` is only updated when you intentionally want to set a new word, not when characters are being added to `input-boxes`.

Here are a few steps you can take to track down and fix the issue:

1. **Search for `setCurrentWord` Calls**:
   Look through your codebase for any calls to `setCurrentWord` (or however you're updating `currentWord` in your state). You want to make sure that this is only being called when you actually want to change the word, not during the chip drop actions.

2. **Review State Update Logic**:
   Check the logic associated with dropping a character chip. Ensure that it's only updating the state relevant to the `input-boxes` and not inadvertently causing `currentWord` to change.

3. **Check for Propagation Issues**:
   If the state update is tied to an event (e.g., a click or drop event), make sure you're not propagating the event to a parent handler that might update `currentWord`.

4. **Refactor `handleSayWord`**:
   If `handleSayWord` should only be called under certain conditions, consider adding additional state or checks to ensure it's only called when appropriate.

5. **Separate Concerns**:
   If the `currentWord` is being used for multiple purposes (e.g., initializing the game and also for checking what to pronounce), you might want to separate these concerns. For example, use a different piece of state to track the word that should be pronounced.

6. **Debugging**:
   Use `console.log` or breakpoints to pinpoint exactly where `currentWord` is being updated in your code. This can help you to understand why `handleSayWord` is being called a second time.

7. **State Dependencies**:
   Make sure that other state updates are not causing a re-render that might lead to an unexpected update of `currentWord`.

By carefully reviewing where and how `currentWord` is being updated, you can likely identify why the second call to `handleSayWord` is occurring. Once you've identified the cause, you can adjust your logic to ensure that `currentWord` is only updated when you want to start the fade-out effect and pronounce a new word.

`currentWord` is only set in here. It was set in `initialState` but I removed that.

```js
  case ActionTypes.INIT_NEW_WORD: {
   const { newWord, newInputBoxChips, shuffledCharacters } = action.payload;
   return {
    ...state,
    currentWord: newWord,
    inputBoxChips: newInputBoxChips,
    characterChips: shuffledCharacters,
    fadeOut: false,
   };
  }
```

---

**Codeium** _at 9:04 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

If `currentWord` is only set in the `ActionTypes.INIT_NEW_WORD` case within your reducer and nowhere else, then the second invocation of `handleSayWord` when you drop a character chip is likely due to the `INIT_NEW_WORD` action being dispatched at that time.

To find out why the `INIT_NEW_WORD` action is being dispatched when a chip is dropped, you'll need to locate where the `dispatch` function is called with `INIT_NEW_WORD`. Here's what to look for:

1. Search for the dispatch call in your codebase:
   Look for any line that dispatches the `INIT_NEW_WORD` action, which might look something like this:

   ```javascript
   dispatch({
     type: ActionTypes.INIT_NEW_WORD,
     payload: {
       newWord,
       newInputBoxChips,
       shuffledCharacters
     }
   });
   ```

2. Review the component or function that dispatches `INIT_NEW_WORD`:
   Once you've found the dispatch call, check under which conditions it is being executed. It should only be dispatched when you want to initialize a new word, not when a chip is dropped.

3. Check for accidental dispatches:
   Ensure that the dispatch call is not being executed unintentionally, such as inside an event handler meant for dropping chips, or as part of a callback that gets called more often than intended.

4. Debugging:
   If the above steps don't clarify why the dispatch is being called, add a `console.log` or breakpoint right before the dispatch of `INIT_NEW_WORD`. Check the call stack at that point to see what event or action led to it.

5. Ensure conditional logic is correct:
   If the dispatch is part of a sequence of operations, ensure that any conditional logic around the dispatch is correct and that it is not mistakenly falling through to dispatch `INIT_NEW_WORD`.

6. Double-check related effects:
   If you're using `useEffect` to dispatch `INIT_NEW_WORD`, make sure the dependencies are correct and that it's not responding to state changes that should not trigger a new word initialization.

7. Review state dependencies:
   Ensure no other state updates or side effects are causing a re-render that might lead to an unexpected dispatch of `INIT_NEW_WORD`.

By examining the situations under which `INIT_NEW_WORD` is dispatched, you should be able to determine why `handleSayWord` is being called with the new word when a chip is dropped and prevent it from happening at the wrong time.

**User** _at 9:06 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

I put a breakpoint at the return of `case ActionTypes.INIT_NEW_WORD` and that breakpoint is not hit when I drag and drop a chip and the `sayWord` is run twice.

---

**Codeium** _at 9:06 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

If the breakpoint in the `ActionTypes.INIT_NEW_WORD` case of your reducer is not hit when you drag and drop a chip, it suggests that the issue is not with dispatching `INIT_NEW_WORD` again. There must be another reason why `handleSayWord(currentWord)` is being called from the second `useEffect` you mentioned earlier.

Here's a step-by-step approach to further troubleshoot the issue:

1. **Verify `currentWord` Updates**:
   Since the unwanted call to `handleSayWord` is in a `useEffect` that depends on `currentWord`, verify if `currentWord` is actually changing when you drag and drop a chip. You can do this by adding a `console.log` statement or using a debugger to inspect the value of `currentWord` before and after dragging and dropping a chip.

   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     console.log('Current word is now:', currentWord);
     if (currentWord) {
       handleSayWord(currentWord);
       startFadeOut();
     }
   }, [currentWord, startFadeOut, handleSayWord]);
   ```

2. **Check for Component Re-renders**:
   Inspect whether the component containing the `useEffect` is re-rendering for some reason, causing the effect to run again. You can use the React DevTools' "Profiler" tab to record and inspect component renders.

3. **Debug `handleSayWord` Directly**:
   Since the reducer case for `INIT_NEW_WORD` does not seem to be the issue, put a breakpoint or a `console.log` directly inside the `handleSayWord` function. This will allow you to inspect when and why it's getting called:

   ```javascript
   const handleSayWord = (word) => {
     console.log('handleSayWord called with:', word);
     // Rest of the function...
   };
   ```

   Use the call stack or log output to see what leads to the call.

4. **Inspect Other Effects or Callbacks**:
   If you have other `useEffect` hooks, `useCallback` hooks, or event handlers that might be calling `handleSayWord`, inspect those as well. It's possible that something else is triggering the function call without changing `currentWord`.

5. **Review State Synchronization**:
   If you use a global state management library (like Redux) or React's Context API, ensure that there's no synchronization issue causing unexpected updates to `currentWord`.

6. **Prop Drilling Issues**:
   If `currentWord` is passed down as a prop to child components, ensure that it's not being modified or causing child components to re-render and call `handleSayWord` indirectly.

7. **Check for Asynchronous Operations**:
   If there are any asynchronous operations that result in calling `handleSayWord`, make sure they are properly managed and not causing race conditions or unexpected calls.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify why `handleSayWord` is being called unexpectedly. Once you find the cause, you can apply the necessary fix to ensure that `handleSayWord` is only called when `currentWord` is intentionally updated to a new word.

**User** _at 9:13 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

I get a bunch of this:

```log
handleSayWord called with word: SHEEP
App.js:284 Current word is now: SHEEP
App.js:119 handleSayWord called with word: undefined
App.js:119 handleSayWord called with word: SHEEP
App.js:284 Current word is now: SHEEP
App.js:284 Current word is now: SHEEP
App.js:119 handleSayWord called with word: undefined
App.js:119 handleSayWord called with word: SHEEP
App.js:284 Current word is now: SHEEP
```

---

**Codeium** _at 9:14 pm, Apr 8, 2024_

The log output indicates that `handleSayWord` is being called multiple times: with the word "SHEEP", with `undefined`, and then with "SHEEP" again. The `undefined` call suggests there might be a reset or clearing of the `currentWord` somewhere in your code that is not directly tied to the `INIT_NEW_WORD` action.

Here are steps to further diagnose the issue:

1. **Check the Order of Logs**:
   The order in which these log statements appear is crucial. They suggest that the `currentWord` is set to "SHEEP", then cleared (set to `undefined`), and then set to "SHEEP" again. This pattern repeats, which might indicate a re-rendering issue or an issue with how state is being managed.

2. **Identify `undefined` Calls**:
   Look for any places in your code where `currentWord` could possibly be set to `undefined`. This could happen if the state is being reset or if there's an error in the logic that sets `currentWord`.

3. **Check for Multiple State Updates in Quick Succession**:
   If you are updating the state of `currentWord` in multiple places very quickly, React might batch these updates, resulting in the function being called multiple times. Ensure that state updates are not being made in rapid succession in a way that could cause this behavior.

4. **Inspect Parent and Child Components**:
   If `currentWord` is being passed down to child components, check if any of those components could be causing the state to update unexpectedly.

5. **Analyze Conditional Rendering**:
   If your component tree conditionally renders based on `currentWord`, it could be unmounting and remounting components, causing effects to run multiple times.

6. **Review Asynchronous Code**:
   If you have asynchronous code that updates `currentWord`, make sure that it has been correctly implemented and doesn't lead to race conditions.

7. **Check for External Triggers**:
   If you're using external libraries or APIs that might change the state, make sure they are not interfering with your state management.

8. **Use State Transition Debugging**:
   You can add debugging statements right before every state transition for `currentWord` to log the previous and next values. This way, you understand exactly where and why the state is changing.

9. **Revisit `useEffect` Dependencies**:
   Make sure that `handleSayWord` and `startFadeOut` are stable (not being re-created on each render) if they are included in the dependency array. If they are re-created frequently, consider using `useCallback` to memoize them.

Based on the log output, you need to find out why `currentWord` is being set to `undefined` and then being set back to "SHEEP". Once you identify where this is happening, you should be able to prevent the unwanted calls to `handleSayWord`. Consider adding more detailed logs surrounding the state updates of `currentWord` to track down the exact lines of code affecting the state.

`undefined` is from when I drag a character, which pulls the string from the `input-boxes` inside the `sayWord` funciton and does not require a word to be passed in.

The log output indicates that the function is being called multiple times. The function is being called twice: once with the variable `am` and once with the variable `null`.
