**User** _at 11:13 pm, Apr 7, 2024_

I want to deploy this React application to GitHub Pages. Can you help me do that? First, I would like to just build it to a static app and deploy the static site to a separate repo by copying the static content to another folder.

---

**Codeium** _at 11:14 pm, Apr 7, 2024_

Certainly! To deploy your React application to GitHub Pages, you'll need to follow a few steps. Here's a general guide on how to do it:

### Step 1: Build Your React App
First, you need to build a static version of your React app. If you're using `create-react-app`, you can do this by running:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command creates a `build` directory with a production build of your app.

### Step 2: Copy the Build to Another Folder
After building your app, you can copy the contents of the `build` directory to another folder where you want to keep the static site for deployment.

You can use the following command to copy the build:

```bash
# Replace '/path/to/your/folder' with the actual path where you want to copy your build
cp -R build/* /path/to/your/folder
```

### Step 3: Create a Separate GitHub Repository
Now, create a new repository on GitHub where you will deploy the static site. You can name it anything you like. Let's call it `your-username.github.io/react-app`.

### Step 4: Push the Static Content to the Repository
Initialize the folder with the static content as a git repository and push it to GitHub:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/folder
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-username.github.io.git
git push -u origin main
```

Make sure to replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username and `your-username.github.io` with the repository name you created in Step 3.

### Step 5: Enable GitHub Pages
Go to the repository settings on GitHub, find the "GitHub Pages" section, and select the `main` branch as the source. GitHub will then deploy the app and provide you with a URL to view it.

Please note that the steps above are for deploying to a separate repository. If you want to deploy your React app in the same repository as your source code, you would typically use a branch like `gh-pages` and push only the build directory to that branch. There are also tools like `gh-pages` npm package that can automate this process.

what is the `-R` switch for?

---

**Codeium** _at 11:19 pm, Apr 7, 2024_

The `-R` switch in the `cp` command stands for "recursive." It is used to copy all files and directories within a specified directory, including all subdirectories and their contents. When you use `cp -R` followed by a source directory and a destination directory, it will copy the entire directory tree from the source to the destination.

Here is the command again for clarity:

```bash
cp -R build/* /path/to/your/folder
```

In this context, `cp -R` is copying all files and directories from within the `build` directory of your React app to the target folder where you intend to keep the static site for deployment. Without the `-R` option, the `cp` command would only copy files and not directories.

**User** _at 11:29 pm, Apr 7, 2024_

When I deploy it to the server I get HTML that looks like this:

```html
<body data-new-gr-c-s-check-loaded="14.1062.0" data-gr-ext-installed=""><noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript><div id="root"></div></body>
```

---

**Codeium** _at 11:29 pm, Apr 7, 2024_

The HTML snippet you've provided is typical for a React application that has been built for production. It includes a `div` with an id of `root`, which is where your React app will be mounted. The `<noscript>` tag provides a message to users who have JavaScript disabled in their browser, informing them that the application requires JavaScript to run.

The `data-new-gr-c-s-check-loaded` and `data-gr-ext-installed` attributes are not standard for React and seem to be added by a browser extension or tool that you're using. These attributes are often related to Grammarly, which is a popular writing assistant tool. Grammarly injects these attributes into the DOM to keep track of the state of the text fields it is checking.

When deploying your app, these attributes do not affect the functionality of your React application, and your users will not see them unless they also have the same extensions installed. However, if you're seeing these attributes in your static files (e.g., in `index.html` after running `npm run build`), you might want to check if Grammarly or a similar browser extension is active in your development environment and consider disabling it before building your application for production.

I mean the page is blank. It doesn't have the components that I built and that in in [@fn:App()](cci:1://d:/T3/Projects/self/spell-and-speak/src/App.js:9:0-266:1)

---

**Codeium** _at 11:31 pm, Apr 7, 2024_

When you deploy a React app and the page is blank, it could be due to several reasons. Here are some common issues and how to troubleshoot them:

1. **Check the Console for Errors**: Open the browser's developer tools and check the console for any JavaScript errors. Errors during the initialization phase could prevent your app from rendering.

2. **Public URL Configuration**: If the app is not served from the root URL (e.g., it's served from `https://username.github.io/react-app/` instead of `https://username.github.io/`), you may need to set the `homepage` field in your `package.json` to match the URL where it's served:

    ```json
    "homepage": "https://username.github.io/react-app/",
    ```

3. **Routing Issues**: If you're using React Router, make sure you're using `BrowserRouter` with a `basename` or `HashRouter` for GitHub Pages, as it uses client-side routing.

4. **Paths to Static Files**: Ensure that paths to your static files (like CSS and JavaScript) are correct. They should be relative to the `index.html` or set correctly if you are using a `homepage` configuration.

5. **Build Folder Contents**: Check if the `build` folder has all the necessary files after running `npm run build`. If some files are missing, the build process might not have completed successfully.

6. **Caching Issues**: Sometimes, the browser might cache an old version of your site. Try doing a hard refresh or clearing your browser's cache.

Since I do not have access to your deployment environment or the full build output, I cannot directly identify the cause of the issue. However, you can start by checking the above points.

If everything seems correct and you're still facing issues, please provide more information or check the deployment steps again to ensure that all files are uploaded correctly and the paths in your code match the server's directory structure.

Yes, I get a few of these `GET https://integr8or.github.io/spell-and-speak/static/js/main.3a4cab32.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)`

---

**Codeium** _at 11:33 pm, Apr 7, 2024_

The error message `GET https://integr8or.github.io/spell-and-speak/static/js/main.3a4cab32.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)` indicates that the browser is trying to load a JavaScript file from the specified URL, but the file is not found on the server. This results in a 404 error.

Here are steps to resolve this issue:

### Check the Paths
Ensure that the JavaScript file actually exists at the path the error message is indicating. If the file is not there, that's why you're getting a 404 error.

### Update `package.json`
If your React app is hosted in a subdirectory (like `spell-and-speak` in your case), you need to tell `create-react-app` about the root URL by adding a `homepage` field to your `package.json`:

```json
"homepage": "https://integr8or.github.io/spell-and-speak",
```

After adding this line, rebuild your app with `npm run build`.

### Check the `build` folder
After rebuilding, check the `build` folder to ensure that the files are generated with the correct paths.

### Deploy the Updated `build` folder
After you rebuild, deploy the updated `build` folder to your GitHub repository.

### Clear Cache and Refresh
Clear your browser cache and refresh the page to ensure that it's not loading an old version.

### Verify GitHub Pages settings
Ensure that GitHub Pages is set up to serve from the `main` branch and the `root` or `docs` folder, depending on where you have your built files.

If you follow these steps and the `main.3a4cab32.js` file is in the correct directory on your GitHub Pages site, the error should be resolved. If the issue persists, double-check that you've correctly pushed all your build artifacts to the GitHub repository.

**User** _at 8:54 am, Apr 8, 2024_

Ok, I was able to build and deploy the build and deploy the build folder to a separate repo and update the hardcoded URLs to the new repo and run the website on GitHub Pages. But that was just a workaround.

Now I would like to get deployment working on the source repo here. 

When I try `npm run deploy` I get:

```ps1
> spell-and-speak@0.1.0 deploy
> gh-pages -d build -r https://github.com/InTEGr8or/spell-and-speak.git

Error: Failed to get remote.origin.url (task must either be run in a git repository with a configured origin remote or must be configured with the "repo" option).
  at D:\T3\Projects\self\spell-and-speak\node_modules\gh-pages\lib\git.js:214:13
  at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:95:5)
```

---

**Codeium** _at 8:55 am, Apr 8, 2024_

The error message you're seeing suggests that the `gh-pages` package cannot find the `remote.origin.url` of your Git repository. This is typically because the directory from which you're trying to deploy is not a Git repository or the `origin` remote is not set.

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

### Step 1: Ensure You're in the Right Directory

Make sure you're in the root directory of your Git repository when you run `npm run deploy`.

### Step 2: Check Git Remote

Check that you have a remote named `origin` configured in your Git repository. Run:

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see the URL of your repository next to `origin`. If it's not set, you can add it with:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/InTEGr8or/spell-and-speak.git
```

### Step 3: Ensure Your Local Repo Is Up to Date

Make sure your local repository is up to date with your remote repository:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

Replace `main` with the name of your default branch if it's different.

### Step 4: Try Deploying Again

After ensuring the `origin` remote is set and your local repository is up to date, try running `npm run deploy` again.

### Step 5: Verify `gh-pages` Configuration

If the above steps don't work, check your `gh-pages` configuration in `package.json`. Since you already have the `repo` option set in the deploy script, it should override the remote URL that `gh-pages` tries to infer.

If the issue persists, you might want to try removing and re-adding the `gh-pages` branch, or clone a fresh copy of the repository to ensure there's no local configuration causing issues.

```ps1
[08:20:41]❯ git remote -v    
origin https://github.com/InTEGr8or/spell-and-speak.git (fetch)

```

---

**Codeium** _at 8:55 am, Apr 8, 2024_

Given that your `origin` remote is correctly set, it seems that the `gh-pages` script may not be recognizing the Git configuration for some reason.

Try the following steps to troubleshoot further:

### Step 1: Check for a Git Repository
Ensure you are in a Git repository by running the following command:

```bash
git status
```

If you receive an error stating that it's not a git repository, then you'll need to initialize one with `git init`. But considering the `origin` remote is set, this is likely not the issue.

### Step 2: Install `gh-pages` if Not Installed
Ensure the `gh-pages` package is installed in your project. If it's not, install it with:

```bash
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
```

### Step 3: Update Your Deployment Script
You can explicitly set the `repo` option in your `package.json` scripts section. This should not be necessary since your `origin` remote is set, but it's worth trying:

```json
"scripts": {
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build -r https://github.com/InTEGr8or/spell-and-speak.git"
}
```

### Step 4: Ensure You Have a `build` Folder
Make sure you have a `build` folder generated by running:

```bash
npm run build
```

The `gh-pages` script will deploy the contents of the `build` directory, so it needs to exist.

### Step 5: Check for Uncommitted Changes
Ensure all changes are committed. Uncommitted changes might cause issues with deployment. Commit any outstanding changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for deployment"
```

### Step 6: Try Deploying Again
After verifying the above, try running the deploy script again:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Step 7: Check Permissions
Ensure that you have permissions to push to the repository. If you are using an access token for authentication, check that it has the correct scopes.

### Step 8: Clear the Cache (Optional)
As a last resort, you can try clearing the cache used by `gh-pages`:

```bash
gh-pages-clean
```

And then run the deploy script again.

If none of these steps solve the issue, consider checking the `gh-pages` documentation for any additional configuration options, or create an issue in the `gh-pages` GitHub repository for more support.

**User** _at 9:00 am, Apr 8, 2024_

I have `gh-pages` 

```json
 "devDependencies": {
  "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object": "^7.21.11",
  "gh-pages": "^6.1.1"
 }

And the PS CLI I posted clearly shows the text of the deploy command used

```ps1

> gh-pages -d build -r https://github.com/InTEGr8or/spell-and-speak.git

Error: Failed to get remote.origin.url (task must either be run in a git repository with a configured origin remote or must be configured with the "repo" option).
  at D:\T3\Projects\self\spell-and-speak\node_modules\gh-pages\lib\git.js:214:13
  at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:95:5)
```

So I think that obviates several of your recommendations.

Can we narrow down the list now?

---

**Codeium** _at 9:00 am, Apr 8, 2024_

Given your `gh-pages` is installed and your `origin` remote is set correctly, let's narrow down the troubleshooting steps:

### Step 1: Clear `gh-pages` Cache
The cache might be causing issues. Clear it with the following command:

```bash
npx gh-pages-clean
```

### Step 2: Verify Branch Permissions
Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to push to the `gh-pages` branch on the repository. If you're using GitHub Actions or any CI/CD pipeline, make sure the token or SSH key has the correct permissions.

### Step 3: Check for Git Directory
The error could also be due to the `gh-pages` script not recognizing the current working directory as a Git repository. This could happen if you're running the command in a different folder or if there's an issue with your Git configuration.

Run the `npm run deploy` command from the root directory of your Git repository where your `.git` folder is located.

### Step 4: Re-Clone the Repository
If the problem persists, try cloning a fresh copy of the repository to a new directory and run the deployment from there. This will rule out any local configuration issues:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InTEGr8or/spell-and-speak.git
cd spell-and-speak
npm install
npm run deploy
```

### Step 5: Manually Push to `gh-pages`
As a last resort, if `gh-pages` still fails, manually push the build folder to the `gh-pages` branch:

```bash
# Checkout to a temporary branch with the contents of the build directory
git checkout --orphan gh-pages-temp
git reset --hard
git clean -df
cp -r path/to/build/* .
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
git push origin gh-pages-temp:gh-pages --force
git checkout main
git branch -D gh-pages-temp
```

This will overwrite the `gh-pages` branch with the contents of your `build` directory.

If you continue to experience the error after trying these steps, it would be worth checking the `gh-pages` package repository for similar issues or consider filing a new issue there.

**User** _at 9:40 am, Apr 8, 2024_

For some reason, I had to change the `package.json` to say:

```json
"homepage": "https://integr8or.github.io/spell-and-speak/build"
```

Instead of just:

```json
"homepage": "https://integr8or.github.io/spell-and-speak/"
```

I don't see that recommended anywhere in the documentation or anything you said.

---

**Codeium** _at 9:40 am, Apr 8, 2024_

The `homepage` field in `package.json` specifies the root URL under which your app is served. When you build a `create-react-app` project, this field is used to determine the base path for your project. It's used for prefixing all the relative paths in your build output, such as links to scripts and stylesheets in your `index.html`.

Typically, when you deploy a `create-react-app` to GitHub Pages, the `homepage` should be set to `"https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/"`. Without the `/build` at the end, because GitHub Pages serves the content from the root of the `gh-pages` branch, or from the `docs` folder on the main branch, depending on your configuration.

Setting `"homepage": "https://integr8or.github.io/spell-and-speak/build"` is unconventional and might lead to issues, as this suggests that the built content should be served from a `build` subdirectory on your GitHub Pages site, which is not the default behavior.

If setting the `homepage` to `"https://integr8or.github.io/spell-and-speak/build"` resolved the issue, it might indicate that there was a mismatch between where your app was looking for its resources and where they were actually deployed. This could have happened if:

- The `gh-pages` deployment script was configured to publish to a subdirectory named `build` on your `gh-pages` branch.
- There was a misconfiguration in the repository settings for GitHub Pages, causing the content to be served from a subdirectory.

In general, you should not need to include `/build` in your `homepage` URL. I recommend checking the deployment settings and ensuring that the build output is at the root of the `gh-pages` branch (or in the `docs` folder if configured that way).

If you're still encountering issues, it's worth checking the repository settings on GitHub and ensuring that GitHub Pages is configured to serve from the right branch and directory. You may also want to examine the structure of the `gh-pages` branch to confirm that the build output is placed correctly.

**User** _at 9:49 am, Apr 8, 2024_

I see. Adding the `build/` is just a temporary workaround to prove that the site can run on GitHub Pages, since the `npm run deploy` failed for whatever reason.

I would like to see if I can get the static site do deploy using GitHub Actions to build and deploy on the server.

I have a `deploy.yml` but it looks like it only deploys to the `gh-pages` branch and the `build/` in that branch. Am I reading that right?

---

**Codeium** _at 9:50 am, Apr 8, 2024_

Based on the `deploy.yml` you provided in your codebase context, it is indeed set up to deploy to the `gh-pages` branch and specifically the `build/` directory within that branch. Here is the relevant part of the workflow:

```yaml
- name: Deploy
  uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.0
  with:
    branch: gh-pages  # The branch the action should deploy to
    folder: build     # The folder the action should deploy
```

This configuration uses the `JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.0` action to automate the deployment process. Here is a breakdown of what happens:

1. The workflow is triggered on a push to the `master` or `main` branch (as specified by the `on` section).
2. It runs on an `ubuntu-latest` virtual machine.
3. It checks out the source code using `actions/checkout@v2`.
4. It sets up Node.js `v14` using `actions/setup-node@v1`.
5. It installs dependencies with `npm install`.
6. It builds the project with `npm run build`, which generates the `build` directory.
7. It deploys the `build` directory to the `gh-pages` branch.

The `folder` option specifies the folder to deploy from, and in this case, it is the `build` directory. This means the contents of the `build` directory should be placed at the root of the `gh-pages` branch, not inside a `build/` subdirectory on the branch.

If your site requires the `build/` subdirectory to function on GitHub Pages, it implies there might be an issue with the paths in your build output; they may be pointing to the wrong location. This should not be the case if the `homepage` is set correctly in `package.json` and the app is built accordingly.

To rectify this, you should:

1. Remove the `build/` from the `homepage` field in your `package.json`:
   ```json
   "homepage": "https://integr8or.github.io/spell-and-speak"
   ```

2. Rebuild your application with `npm run build`.

3. Check the build output to ensure the paths in `index.html` and other static files are correct relative to the root.

4. Use the GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the `build` directory to the `gh-pages` branch again. Ensure that the workflow runs after you push the changes to your `package.json`.

5. Verify that the `gh-pages` branch has the correct content at the root level and not inside a `build/` subdirectory.

6. Ensure GitHub Pages is configured to serve from the `gh-pages` branch and the `/ (root)` directory in your repository settings.

**User** _at 9:52 am, Apr 8, 2024_

So, should I change the `with` section to look like this:

```yml
   with:
    branch: gh-pages # The branch the action should deploy to
    folder: /   # The folder the action should deploy
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # GitHub automatically creates a GITHUB_TOKEN secret to use in your workflow
```

---

**Codeium** _at 9:52 am, Apr 8, 2024_

No, the `with` section in your `deploy.yml` workflow file should not be changed to deploy from the root folder `/`. The `folder` option specifies the directory from which the GitHub Action will take files to deploy to the `gh-pages` branch, not where to place them on the branch. You should keep this option set to `build` to indicate that the built static files from the `build` directory should be deployed.

Here's the correct configuration to deploy the contents of the `build` directory to the root of the `gh-pages` branch:

```yaml
with:
  branch: gh-pages  # The branch the action should deploy to
  folder: build     # The folder the action should deploy FROM
  token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # GitHub automatically creates a GITHUB_TOKEN secret to use in your workflow
```

The action will take the contents of the `build` directory and place them at the root of the `gh-pages` branch. There should be no `build/` subdirectory in the `gh-pages` branch unless your build process is configured to create one inside the `build` directory itself.

Remember to make sure that your `package.json` has the correct `homepage` set, as previously mentioned, to ensure that the paths are correct in the build output:

```json
"homepage": "https://integr8or.github.io/spell-and-speak"
```

After making the adjustments, commit your changes and push them to your repository to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow.

**User** _at 9:56 am, Apr 8, 2024_

So, if deployment is successful, I should see the `gh-branch` with nothing but the contents of the `build/`?

---

**Codeium** _at 9:56 am, Apr 8, 2024_

Yes, that's correct. If the deployment is successful using the GitHub Actions workflow with the configuration you have, the `gh-pages` branch should contain only the contents of the `build` directory from your project, and there should be no additional nested `build/` directory within the `gh-pages` branch.

The root of the `gh-pages` branch should directly contain the `index.html` file and other static assets such as the `static` folder generated by the `npm run build` command. This structure allows GitHub Pages to serve your site directly from the root URL configured in your `homepage` field of `package.json`.

After the GitHub Actions workflow runs, you can check the content of the `gh-pages` branch by cloning it locally or by browsing the files on GitHub. If everything looks correct, your site should be accessible at the URL you specified in your `homepage`, which would be:

```
https://integr8or.github.io/spell-and-speak/
```

**User** _at 10:00 am, Apr 8, 2024_

how do I upgrade node?

---

**Codeium** _at 10:01 am, Apr 8, 2024_

To upgrade Node.js on your local machine, you can use a version manager for Node.js such as `nvm` (Node Version Manager) on macOS and Linux or `nvm-windows` on Windows. These tools allow you to install multiple versions of Node.js and switch between them.

Here are the steps to upgrade Node.js using `nvm` on macOS or Linux:

### Using nvm (macOS and Linux):

1. Open a terminal.
2. To install or update `nvm`, you can use the install script using cURL:
    ```bash
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
    ```
   Or Wget:
    ```bash
    wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
    ```
3. Close and reopen your terminal.
4. Check if `nvm` was installed correctly with:
    ```bash
    command -v nvm
    ```
5. To install the latest version of Node.js, run:
    ```bash
    nvm install node
    ```
6. To use the newly installed version, run:
    ```bash
    nvm use node
    ```
7. Confirm that Node.js has been upgraded by checking the version:
    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

### Using nvm-windows (Windows):

1. Go to the [nvm-windows releases page](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases) and download the latest `nvm-setup.zip`.
2. Unzip and run the installer.
3. Open a new command prompt or PowerShell window.
4. To install the latest version of Node.js, run:
    ```powershell
    nvm install latest
    ```
5. To switch to the newly installed version, run:
    ```powershell
    nvm use <version>
    ```
   Replace `<version>` with the specific version number you installed.
6. Confirm that Node.js has been upgraded by checking the version:
    ```powershell
    node -v
    ```

For other environments or if you prefer to install Node.js directly without a version manager, you can download the latest installer from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and run it.

Remember that after upgrading Node.js, you should check your Node.js applications and dependencies for compatibility with the new version.

On Windows, you can use `nvm-windows`, which is a Node.js version manager specifically for Windows. Here's how to upgrade Node.js using `nvm-windows`:

### Step 1: Install nvm-windows

If you haven't already installed `nvm-windows`, you can download it from the [nvm-windows GitHub releases page](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases).

1. Download the latest `nvm-setup.zip` file.
2. Unzip it and run the installer.
3. Follow the installer prompts to complete the installation.

### Step 2: Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell Window

Open a new command prompt or PowerShell window to ensure you're using the freshly installed `nvm-windows` commands.

### Step 3: Install the Latest Version of Node.js

To install the latest version of Node.js, run:

```powershell
nvm install latest
```

If you want to install a specific version of Node.js, you can specify the version number like so:

```powershell
nvm install 16.13.0
```

### Step 4: Use the New Version

After installation, you can switch to the new version of Node.js with the following command:

```powershell
nvm use <version>
```

Replace `<version>` with the version number you just installed. If you installed the latest version, run:

```powershell
nvm use latest
```

### Step 5: Confirm the Version

To confirm that you're now using the new version of Node.js, run:

```powershell
node -v
```

This will display the currently active Node.js version.

### Step 6: Set a Default Node Version (Optional)

If you want to set a default Node.js version for new terminals, use:

```powershell
nvm alias default <version>
```

Replace `<version>` with the version number you want to set as default.

### Additional Note

When using `nvm-windows`, be aware that only one version of Node.js can be active at a time. If you have multiple projects that require different Node.js versions, you can switch between them using `nvm use <version>` as needed for each project.

Always remember to restart your terminal or command prompt after switching versions for the changes to take effect.

I get this:

```ps1
🕐[09:54:57]❯ nvm install latest
Node.js v21.7.2 is not yet released or available.
```

The `latest` tag might not always be recognized by `nvm-windows` in the same way as it is on Unix systems with `nvm`. Instead, you should specify the version number you want to install or use the `node` keyword which `nvm-windows` interprets as the latest stable Node.js version. Here's how you can install the latest stable version:

```powershell
nvm install node
```

And then you can switch to it using:

```powershell
nvm use node
```

If you want to see what versions are available to install, you can list all the Node.js versions by running:

```powershell
nvm list available
```

This will display a list of all the Node.js versions you can install. You can then install a specific version by running `nvm install` followed by the version number, for example:

```powershell
nvm install 16.13.0
```

And to use that specific version:

```powershell
nvm use 16.13.0
```

Remember, after installing a new version of Node.js, you can check the current active version with:

```powershell
node -v
```

This should reflect the version you just installed and switched to using `nvm-windows`.
