# Spell and Speak Game Project Summary

## Overview
The "Spell and Speak" project is a web-based game designed to help users practice spelling and pronunciation. Users interact with draggable character chips that represent letters, which they can place into input boxes to form words. The current word is associated with an animal, and the game progresses through different animals.

## Key Features
- Draggable character chips for constructing words
- Input boxes to receive character chips
- Speech synthesis to pronounce words
- Local storage to persist the current animal index
- Responsive touch interactions for mobile devices

## Implementation Details

### State Management
The application uses the `useReducer` hook for state management. The state includes:
- `characterChips`: Array of draggable character objects
- `inputBoxChips`: Object mapping input box IDs to character chip IDs
- `hasDropped`: Boolean indicating if a chip has been dropped
- `fadeOut`: Boolean for controlling fade-out animations
- `animalIndex`: Current index in the animal array
- `currentWord`: The word associated with the current animal

### Handling Drag and Drop
- `onDragStart`: Stores the chip ID and parent ID in `dataTransfer`.
- `onDrop`: Retrieves the chip ID and parent ID, updates the state accordingly.

### Handling Touch Interactions
- `onTouchStart`: Similar to `onDragStart`, but for touch events.
- `onTouchMove`: Moves the chip according to touch location; prevents default to stop page scrolling.
- `onTouchEnd`: Handles the drop logic for touch events.

### Event Listener Attachment for Touch Events
To prevent page scrolling on touch devices, non-passive touch event listeners are attached manually using refs to each `CharacterChip` component.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Create refs for each character chip
}, [characterChips]);

useEffect(() => {
  // Attach a non-passive 'touchmove' event listener to each character chip
}, [chipRefs]);
```

### Speech Synthesis
- Words are pronounced using the SpeechSynthesis API.
- Functions like `sayWord` and `handleSayWord` are used to facilitate this feature.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Preventing Default Touch Behavior
The `touchmove` event was causing the page to scroll when moving chips. To prevent this, non-passive event listeners were attached to the `CharacterChip` components using refs and `addEventListener` with `{ passive: false }`.

### Event Listener Duplication
Initially, touch events were handled both through React's synthetic event system and manual event listener attachments, causing multiple invocations. The solution was to use React's system for `onTouchEnd` and manual attachment with `{ passive: false }` for `onTouchMove`.

### Moving Forward
For future work on the project, it's important to maintain the distinction between touch and mouse event handling, ensure that event listeners are correctly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks, and continue to test touch interactions on various devices for robustness and responsiveness.
